1
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,562
<i>First of all, I want
to thank everybody for coming!</i>

2
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,311
<i>Giving up your lunch hours
and all that.</i>

3
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,395
- <i>Lord knows, it's very exciting for all of us.</i>
- <i>Happy to be here.</i>

4
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,524
- <i>Oh, me too.</i>
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

5
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,320
- <i>Let's just get our hands into it. Who wants to start us off?</i>
- <i>I'll be happy to start.</i>

6
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,902
- <i>Y'know what, Gwen, why don't you start us off?</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,328
- <i>You don't need the pointer here, do you?</i>
- <i>No, I don't need the pointer.</i>

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,827
- <i>I'll just hold onto it, then.</i>
- <i>Oh, she's fine. Gwen?</i>

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,659
<i>There is a concern that I have that
I think needs addressing...</i>

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,371
<i>is that we can't have the port-o-potties
too far off the main route,</i>

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,252
<i>because we do have
a lot of seniors.</i>

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,878
Uh, we've solved that.

13
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,802
We're gonna take the port-o-potties and put 'em right over here.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,049
They're not gonna be
in the way.

15
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,554
We're gonna put a receptacle
over near arts and crafts.

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,350
- These are big bins you're talking about?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,680
We've got barrels, too. We're gonna
put the barrels on every corner.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,060
- That's the crate?
- That's the big barrel.

19
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,111
- That's the big barrel, 'cause you got pie eating right over here.
- It's more of a dumpster than....

20
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,904
That's another thing — if anything happens
like last year with that pie eating...

21
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,654
Which brings me to a point:
security.

22
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,492
- Oh...
- Security: I say we put a-a rifle on here,

23
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,495
- A man with a rifle here and a rifle here.
- Oh, please.

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,918
- Protect the whole square.
- Don't start that.
- Is that really necessary?

25
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,580
- Yes. Remember how much we got egged last year?
- Every year he has to bring this up?
- Absolutely.

26
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,628
What can I tell you,
we're pleased as punch.

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,377
We... we are so proud.
We know that...

28
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,010
whatever we do here is a first for
Blaine and a first for Missouri.

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,134
Whatever we do is going to be
the standard against which...

30
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,891
all other sesquicentennials —
that's the 150 —

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,054
will be judged.

32
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,149
The people of Blaine
are can-do people.

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,443
In fact, y'know, there's an
old saying in Missouri that...

34
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,737
"If you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes."

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:01,660
In Blaine, I honestly believe, with hard work we
can get that down to three or four minutes.

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,581
Here in our sesquicentennial year,
we've got a lot to talk about.

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,534
There's a lot to be proud of.
And we're very proud of it.

38
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,745
It's about time the world
knows more about Blaine.

39
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,997
We're chompin' at the bit certainly
from this end to get it out there.

40
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,093
It all started, uh,
with Blaine Fabin.

41
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,045
He was hired
by thirty settlers...

42
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,219
to lead a wagon train expedition
from Philadelphia to California.

43
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,558
On the fourteenth night,
word has it,

44
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,432
they were sitting
around the campfire,

45
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,730
and Blaine said,
"Do you smell it?

46
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,647
Do you smell
the salt in the air?"

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,101
He said, "We're here.
I've brought you to California."

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,903
So there was a big party that night.
Next morning they got up.

49
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,153
They didn't see the ocean,

50
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,984
because they were
in Missouri.

51
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,867
Uh, Blaine was able to convince
them for a little while...

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,368
that it was just
low tide and things.

53
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,041
But what had happened was that
he had made some mistakes, bad weather,

54
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,460
uh, wasn't familiar
with the proper route.

55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,881
But, as it turns out, everybody was
quite happy to be where they were.

56
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,459
So they said, "It's okay we didn't make it
to California. We'll stay here."

57
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,011
And that's why
I'm at this desk.

58
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,380
Well, I'm
very proud to say...

59
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,429
that I'm a direct descendant
of Blaine Fabin.

60
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,727
I've lived here
all my life, uh,

61
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,894
as did my parents and their parents
and their parents and their parents and...

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,021
so on and so forth. Um.

63
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,269
I'm very excited
about the show coming up,

64
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,323
because, uh, it'll be the first time
I'll have the experience...

65
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,869
of sitting in the audience
and seeing actors portray...

66
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:30,036
my ancestor,
the actual Blaine Fabin.

67
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,082
Being a Fabin...

68
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,785
is not always easy.

69
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,998
Um, I can certainly understand
how the Kennedys feel.

70
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,168
I had been living in New York...

71
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,924
and working there
as an actor...

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,132
and director and choreographer
for twenty five years or so.

73
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,808
And I really felt
I needed a change.

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,432
I imagined in my fantasy,
I suppose,

75
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,185
that when I came here,

76
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,483
I would have
a completely different life;

77
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:01,439
uh, perhaps, um,
a construction worker...

78
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,740
or one of those guys
that works on those...

79
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,243
high-wire things that, uh...
with the hard hat.

80
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,822
You know, that
sweeping sort of hat.

81
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,157
And, uh, with the chaps.

82
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,167
Uh, but that didn't
really work out.

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,711
I began to realize,
I guess,

84
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,539
that the theater
was still in my blood,

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,251
and what I still had to do
was make use of that.

86
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,055
So, I offered my services
to the high school here.

87
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,971
And they accepted.
And I began to teach drama.

88
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,271
And within about six months,
I had formed the Blaine community players.

89
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,314
I gotta tell you,
we are very, very excited...

90
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,643
about the big show that's
happening at the end of the festival.

91
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,572
Everyone right now is just going
crazy getting ready to audition.

92
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,567
And, uh, unfortunately,
I won't be able to audition.

93
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,657
We have to stock that day
and can't get out of it.

94
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,831
And Corky will not let me s... uh,
audition any other time,

95
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,333
so "That's show business,"
is what he told me,

96
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,537
and, uh, you know, he's the master.
You gotta give him credit for that.

97
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,005
President McKinley
did a whistle-stop tour...

98
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,879
back in, uh, 1898.

99
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,340
A little boy, Jimmy McBean,
made a stool for him.

100
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,298
And he loved it so much
that he called back and said,

101
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,305
"Lookit, I would like to give more of
these to dignitaries who are visiting."

102
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,978
And before you knew it,

103
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,557
uh, Blaine is manufacturing
all these footstools.

104
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,104
And uh... that's how the... big...
that-that's how we got the stool boom.

105
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,655
Blaine became
the stool capital of the world.

106
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,031
My first show was <i>Barefoot in the Park,</i>
which was an absolute smash.

107
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,240
But my production
on the stage of <i>Backdraft...</i>

108
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,450
was what really
got them excited.

109
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,254
This whole idea
of "in-your-face theater"...

110
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,001
really affected them.

111
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,001
The conceptualization,
the whole abstraction,

112
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,176
the obtuseness
of this production, to me,

113
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,720
was what was interesting.

114
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,548
I wanted the audience
to feel the heat...

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,766
from the fire, the fear,

116
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,062
because people
don't like fire poked...

117
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,559
poked in their noses.

118
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,687
Y'know when you get a cinder from
barbecue right on the end of your nose,

119
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,313
and you kind of make
that little face.

120
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,020
That's not a good thing.

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,697
I wanted to have
the sense memory of that.

122
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,319
So during the show,

123
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,117
I had someone
burn newspapers...

124
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,742
and send it through
the vents in the theater.

125
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,165
Well, they freaked out.

126
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,208
Of course,
the fire marshal came over.

127
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,753
And they shut us down
for a couple of days.

128
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,044
Mr. Bluestein,
<i>Montezuma's Revenge</i> is nothing more...

129
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,002
than good, old-fashioned,
American diarrhea.

130
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,884
Adult diapers should never
even enter the picture.

131
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,508
So you lose
a few pounds.

132
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,348
My mom used to say
that Blaine is...

133
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,273
a little town with a big heart
in the heart of a big country.

134
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,104
And to me, Blaine
is a kind of town...

135
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,687
where I can have
my own business,

136
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,198
meet and marry a wonderful
woman like Sheila...

137
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,411
- A-and be something, be somebody.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

138
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,329
Some people
find it ironical that,

139
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,624
even though we run a travel agency,
we've never been outside of Blaine.

140
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,129
- With one exception.
- Well, we've never been out...

141
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,252
Well, I went
to Jefferson City once.

142
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,005
- It was a...
- Tell them why.

143
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,219
It was a medical reason.

144
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,513
You can tell them.

145
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,428
Just minor surgery.

146
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,814
I've been workin' here
at the D.Q. for about,

147
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:24,857
um,

148
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,776
eight months, seven?

149
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,783
I don't know, somethin' like that.
It's fun.

150
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,319
You just do the cones,

151
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,412
make sundaes, make blizzards...

152
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,741
and... put stuff on 'em.

153
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,498
And... see a lot
of people come in.

154
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,704
A lot of people
come to the D.Q.

155
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,165
Burgers, ice cream...

156
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,550
anything, you know?

157
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,505
Cokes. Just drive in and
get a coke, if you're thirsty.

158
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,802
Everybody thinks that Roswell
was the first sighting...

159
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,511
of a U.F.O.
in the United States.

160
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,724
And that's bull-roar.
We had the first sighting here in 1946.

161
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,026
And it wasn't just a sighting.
It didn't just fly by.

162
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,856
They stopped,
and they landed.

163
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,653
The people in Blaine went on board the ship for a potluck dinner.

164
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,695
I've been coming out to this landing
site every day for two years...

165
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,617
to measure it.

166
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,707
And here's the thing:

167
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,494
the circumference
and the diameter...

168
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,796
change by a few inches,

169
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,374
yet the radius
remains the same.

170
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,002
Which brings me back
to the number five.

171
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,179
There are five letters
in the name "Blaine."

172
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,890
Mix the word "Blaine" up.
Mix it around.

173
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,967
Eventually you'll get "Nebali."

174
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,016
Nebali, the name
of the planet...

175
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,315
in a galaxy way, way,

176
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,518
way far away.

177
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,901
I'll tell you another thing:
once you step inside this circle,

178
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,865
the weather never changes.

179
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,659
It is always 67 degrees...

180
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,035
with a 40 % chance
of rain, always.

181
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,325
I-I love to make people laugh,

182
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,163
and I've been doing it since,
you know, school.

183
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,919
People ask me,
"Were you, uh, were...

184
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,751
you must have been
the class clown."

185
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,096
And I say, uh,
"No, I wasn't."

186
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,476
But I sat beside the class clown,
and I studied him...

187
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,351
and saw how he made
people laugh.

188
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,774
And... and so I picked
some things up.

189
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,443
And, you know, at parties
and family functions,

190
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,364
I have to say, I love,
you know, breaking people up.

191
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,108
So there's a thing...

192
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,445
I think I got
an entertaining bug...

193
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,415
from my grandfather,
Chaim Pearlgut,

194
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,289
who was very, very big
in the, uh,

195
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,878
Yiddish theater
back in New York.

196
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,050
He was in the very...
the sardonically irreverent...

197
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,175
"Dybbuk Shmybbuk,
I Said, 'More Ham.'"

198
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,932
And that revue,
I believe, was 1914.

199
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,307
And that revue
is what made him famous.

200
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,398
Incidentally, the song,
"Bubbe Made a Kishke"...

201
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,146
came from that revue.

202
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,397
My-my father...

203
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,529
bless him... brought me
into the business.

204
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,608
This was
his dental practice before.

205
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,069
And I joke with
my wife that, you know,

206
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,574
at that point,
that's when the, uh,

207
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,875
the money started,
uh, rolling in, you know.

208
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,002
"Brave making...

209
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,377
"more wampum
to buy pelts.

210
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,504
"One happy squaw
in wigwam.

211
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,090
Happy as mongoose."

212
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,471
That, uh,

213
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,053
is, of course,
from Johnny Carson,

214
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,812

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,529
Um, and...

233
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,411
part of my job,
and a very important part,

234
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,242
is to put on
a show every year,

235
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,794

completely by myself.

00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,786
Allan Pearl. Interesting-- how do these p...
where do they come from?

333
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,579
Y'know, sure, I'd seen him around.

334
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,790
It would never have occurred
to me to walk up to the...

335
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,380
dentist and say, you know,
"Are you interested in this?"

336
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,712
But I was...

337
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,672
shopping for my wife, Bonnie—

338
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,053
—I buy most of her clothes—

339
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,557
and... Mrs. Pearl...

340
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,434
was in the same shop.

341
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,269
And it just was an accident.

342
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,186
Y'know we started talking
about pantyhose.

343
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,648
She was saying... whatever,
that's not the point of the story,

344
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,780
but what the point is
was that through this accidental meeting...

345
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,534
it's like, you know,
it's like a hitchcock movie,

346
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,206
where, you know, you're thrown
into a rubber bag...

347
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,705
and put in the trunk
of a car.

348
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,376
You find people.
You find them.

349
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,754
Something... it...
is it karma?

350
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,964
Maybe.

351
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,135
But we found 'em.
That's the important thing.

352
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,009
And I got Bonnie
a wonderful pantsuit.

353
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,386
They took me off
into a separate room.

354
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,475
I seen 'em takin' different people off,
different ones of us off in separate rooms.

355
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,227
And put me
on a big, white table.

356
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,866
And the guy that take me there...
the one of them that took me in there,

357
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,942
to examine me, I guess,
he probed me.

358
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:46,031
And then I was in there, l bet,
more than three or four hours,

359
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,615
in that room being probed.

360
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,502
At one time or another,
different ones of 'em come in.

361
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,579
Four, five, six of 'em
at different times.

362
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,130
And all of 'em probed me.

363
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,801
Not all at once, you know.
Individually.

364
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,217
Later on, years later,
now even still...

365
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,971
It's a funny thing.
It happened on a Sunday.

366
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,973
And every Sunday,
about the time...

367
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,147
That I was taken
on board that... that ship,

368
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,146
Uh, I find I have
no feelings in my buttocks.

369
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,774
Casting a show is really only
the beginning of the process.

370
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,860
There's also
the whole design concept:

371
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,914
What fabrics will work for
the costumes, the lighting.

372
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,167
And it really becomes
a "wrasslin'" match, I guess,

373
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,287
Between me
and the muse of theater...

374
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,295
And, most of all, dance.

375
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,189
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I'd like you to try somethin'.

376
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,152
What are you thinkin'?
What are you feelin' right now with your eyes closed?

377
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,737
I feel a bree... a...
you're blowing in my ear.

378
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,824
- Okay, all right. You jumped to a conclusion.
- Oh. I'm...

379
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,408
See, what I'm
asking for is...

380
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,961
Your first feeling was not
that I was blowing on you.

381
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,288
It was more like...

382
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,085
- "Virgin isles" or "Bahamanian"...
- Ohh.

383
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,007
- Or "Arubian" or...
- Yes.

384
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,932
Yeah, he's at his rehearsal.
He's at his first rehearsal.

385
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,513
I don't know what they're doin',
'cause I never been to one.

386
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,393
But I bet they're introducing
themselves to each other.

387
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,725
You know, it... it's gonna be
nice to meet some of these, um,

388
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,942
New folks, 'cause, uh,
we don't socialize with, uh,

389
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,113
The creative types,
you know.

390
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,532
We got our scrabble club
and stuff,

391
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,739
You know, and other
people with babies.

392
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,464
the exercises
all mean somethin',

393
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,008
Even if
you don't know what.

394
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,425
Dr. Pearl, well,
he'll come around.

395
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,426
And he'll learn,

396
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,726
Like, uh, Ron and Sheila
and I have learned...

397
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,223
That Corky has a vision.

398
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,613
Woo!

399
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,577
- Oh!
- Forget about it!

400
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,747
Forget about it.

401
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,420
With you, it's okay.
But with him! He thought...

402
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,339
I, uh...

403
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,667
I'm walking... On air.

404
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,214
You know, I'm...

405
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,504
This is a sensation
which is... forget it.

406
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,011
When I became a dentist,
I thought I was happy. But this is...

407
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,843
This is making me
nervous now.

408
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,521
Because I could have
wasted a lot of years.

409
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,480
I must say, I was very shocked
that Dr. Pearl had been cast.

410
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,439
Then I thought...

411
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,615
We're in a glamor profession, being travel agents.
He isn't in such a glamorous...

412
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,193
You know, one project...
we have to loosen him up.

413
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,870
He's a little tight,
particularly when he's around us, probably.

414
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,489
I don't think
he'll mind jokes.

415
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,872
- You're intimidating because you have so much experience.
- I can't help it.

416
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,751
Ron is going to help everyone act,
'cause I know... Ron gives me...

417
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,715
Well, in all the productions we've been in,
and when we do scene studies at home together,

418
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,928
Ron will have extensive hour,
two-hour sessions of notes for me.

419
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,219
- And it's so helpful...
- It's notes for both of us.

420
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,058
- No, but lately...
- You get most.

421
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,557
He's trying to help me change my instincts or at least ignore them.

422
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,525
Listen, let me tell you why
I'm here. We're doing a show.

423
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,274
I won't beat around the bush.
We're doing a show that I've written....

424
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,777
About the 150th
anniversary of Blaine.

425
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,036
- And I know you're an old Blainian.
- Yes, yes.

426
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,415
And you're really right
for one of the parts.

427
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,370
It's the narrator
in the show.

428
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,131
One of the actor parts? Oh, I don't know.
- Yeah.

429
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,254
I've heard...
I think you're being modest.

430
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,803
I've heard you've had some
history in show business.

431
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:12,801
Well, you know,

432
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,509
I did have a hankerin'
to be an actor...

433
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,471
When I was a young feller when I got out of the coast guard.

434
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,851
But I went
to taxidermy school instead.

435
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,934
Well, I took a correspondence course.
- Uh-huh.

436
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,894
I'll tell you something,
Mr. Wooley.

437
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,777
What I'm looking for
in my shows are actors...

438
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,530
And people that are
willing to work hard.

439
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,829
Well, I-I am a hard worker,
as you can see.

440
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,078
- Oh, I love all the work you've done.
- Makes sense.

441
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:45,288
That's a little gun rack made out of deer hooves.
- Oh, yeah.

442
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,208
Boy, I didn't know deers
could do that, you know.

443
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,717
I know this comes
outta left field,

444
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,845
But I'm looking
for another actor.

445
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,804
I was wondering if you had any interest in participating in the show.

446
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,351
Does that appeal to you
in any way?

447
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,229
I'm not much of an actor. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I...

448
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,608
I never done that... anything like that before, really.
- Uh-huh.

449
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,191
Okay, fair enough. But it might
be interesting, you know.

450
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,278
Well, what... do you get off tonight?
What time do you get off tonight?

451
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,205
- I get off at 8:00.
- At 8:00 tonight?

452
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,454
- Yeah.
- Really? That's a long day.

453
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,253
Yeah. Hey, Dad,
this is Mr...

454
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,922
- St. Clair.
- St. Clair. He's a drama guy.

455
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,422
Yeah. And, um, at 8:00, you're off, though?
- Right.

456
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,213
I have to tell ya,
I'm not much of an actor or singer.

457
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,595
Well, you know, that's
what Charles Laughton said.

458
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,347
And look what happened.

459
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,020
Did you change the fan belt
on that blue Chevy?

460
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,689
No, I haven't
done that yet.

461
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,980
Well, when you get done here, will you get on that?
- Yeah.

462
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,235
- Um, so how tall are you?
- 6'2".

463
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,440
- Really?
- Hmm.

464
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,275
Wow.

465
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,572
♪ It's all the same ♪

466
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,617
When we say, "Nothing
ever happens in Blaine,"

467
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:09,547
Could we try
you two singing "Blaine,"

468
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,958
Where we really hear
the "N" at the end.

469
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,886
And you guys just go,
"Nothing ever happens in Blay."

470
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,759
Don't say the "N."
They say the "N's."

471
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,717
"Nothing ever happens.
It's all the same."

472
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,061
And you sing, "It's all the say."
Let's try it once.

473
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,851
Okay, Jeannie, one, two, three and...

474
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,898
I know it's hard
to jump into this,

475
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,770
Because it must seem
like a new world.

476
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,946
But we're gonna
ease you into it.

477
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,777
If you ever have any questions,
you can always call me up.

478
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,612
Give you my... I have a private number.
It's not listed.

479
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,324
So don't lose it, and do not
give it out to anyone.

480
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,127
"How high a ridge,
I could not tell.

481
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,829
- "For the sun...
- Okay, but... yeah, but not...

482
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,541
- The sun has..."
- Yeah, not pinching your shirt.

483
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,548
- I want... I want, you see, hook in those thumbs.
- Thumb?

484
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,049
Yeah.
There you go.

485
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,553
Yeah. Just...
that's right.

486
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,517
"How high a ridge,
I could not tell."

487
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,891
See what's happening
with your voice already?

488
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,314
It's almost as if you're
squeezing your boobies out.

489
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,277
- It's gonna be goin' out to that audience.
- Pushing it right out.

490
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,617
I could try it out.
"How... how high a ridge I could not tell!"

491
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,246
Keep in time. Okay.

492
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,211
Right. Robin in the nest.

493
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,506
Okay? Right.

494
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,337

I don't want to interfere.

503
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,769
But... I think
it would be...

504
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,557
- I think we have to work...
- I can't hear you.

505
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,144
I think we have to work
on the music a little bit more.

506
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,652
Fine.
- But I don't want to make trouble. So...

507
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,033
I don't really want to do this
in front of them.

508
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,703
- But I think...
- Where do you want to do it?

509
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,700
I think we have to sit down
and make a schedule...

510
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,626
That includes
some... some music time.

511
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,205
'Cause I think
Jeanne and I...

512
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,216
- Have to work...
- Why are you whispering?

513
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,959
I'm right here,
you know?

514
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,213
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you
want me to talk louder?

515
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:08,267
Because l-l think that...

516
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,177
Now it's too loud.

517
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,934
You know, just talk like
a normal person, okay?

518
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,229
I think what they were doing
was good.

519
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,444
- You rehearse. You rehearse. You get it perfect.
- Yes, you rehearse...

520
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,398
You know exactly what you're doing,
and then you forget about it.

521
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,614
You said, they learn it,
they forget it, and that's okay.

522
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,912
- That's great.
- Well, they've forgotten it.

523
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,288
They never learned it. When did they learn it?
When do we have the time...

524
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,916
But if they're gonna forget it anyway,
what difference does it make?

525
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,374
- You see? It's like one of those...
- No, I...

526
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,255
It's like a...
it's a zen thing.

527
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,587
It's like, you know,
you know,

528
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,719
"How many babies fit in... in the... in the tire?"
Thing.

529
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,268
- That whole... the old joke, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,393
Mm-hmm. No, you have a point.
It's an interesting point.

531
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,894
And how'd you find this place?

532
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,273
Well, we've been, uh,

533
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,023
- Coming here for many years.
- Yeah, we come every Thursday.

534
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,444
- With rehearsals, we won't be able to now.
- This is true.

535
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:13,158
In China, they'll kill a monkey at the table,
eat the brains right out.

536
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,412
We have friends, Barbara and Bruce,
- Eww.

537
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,216
Who went to China... I'm sure,
you're in the travel business, you've been there.

538
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,339
They went to Peking,
where they make the ducks.

539
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,011
And what they say is that the food over there is not as good.

540
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,765
You can't get a sauce
as thick and sweet over there.

541
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,767
- The food is steamed.
- They didn't have a good time.

542
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,314
They should have
called you.

543
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,100
Yeah, we've got
some good packages.

544
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,938
If you ever want to get to Miami beach,
we got a great package, two weeks...

545
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,905
- Oh, really?
- All expense... yeah.

546
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,360
You get everything you need.
Every kind of food in Blaine.

547
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,915
- You know, you got Chinese here, and no need to go.
- We're talking about Miami now.

548
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,995
Yeah, we'd love to go.
- We got a great package, a week, two weeks.

549
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,752
Like there aren't Chinese people in Miami.
- Well, we should.

550
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,458
What does that have to do...
of course.

551
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,173
- "We're talking about China now."
- We're talking about Miami.

552
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,675
"Miami. We're talking
about Miami now."

553
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,098
Put some food on your stomach
before you have more wine.

554
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,100
What's it...
what's it...

555
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,019
Shh. Girl talk.

556
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,522
What's it like to be
with a circumcised man?

557
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,067
That is interesting.

558
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,942
I'd ask more, but Ron said
the whole Jew thing's...

559
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,023
Hmm.

560
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,279
When Ron had his surgery...

561
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,454
- All right. All right.
- I said, "Hey, circumcise it while you're at it."

562
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,873
I had never been
with anyone else.

563
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,867
- I, well...
- Ron's the only man.

564
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:43,205
What surgery did he have?
A minor corrective surgery.

565
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,383
- Can we have some coffee at this table, please?
- It's not minor anymore.

566
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,630
Well, maybe we should change the subject.
- No. It's...

567
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,557
I had what, you know,
most guys would,

568
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,726
Uh, dream of, you know.

569
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:00,890
I had to have
a penis reduction surgery.

570
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,849
- I'm sorry?
- Penis reduction.

571
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,816
- There aren't many. You're gonna say, "I never heard of that."
- Penis reduction?

572
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,564
I said, "Ron, do something."

573
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,568
He said, "Why don't you get one
of those vagina enlargements?"

574
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,653
Dear! Can we have
some coffee over here?

575
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,623
Have you tried the egg rolls? Unbelievable.
- Let me ask you something.

576
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,666
- You're a medical man.
- Yes.

577
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,791
I want to ask you something. If you'd...
- Oh!

578
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,044
Oh, for heaven's sake! No, no! No!
- Don't do that.

579
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,175
- Doctor, please...
- Medicine man not go near dances with stumpy. No.

580
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,847
Everybody? Everybody?

581
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,140
I have a little announcement
to make.

582
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,097
I wasn't gonna tell you.

583
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:43,433
I sent out ten letters to different producers in New York City.

584
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,568
This is from the Oppenheimer organization.

585
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,861
"Dear Mr. St. Clair:

586
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,739
"In response
to your letter,

587
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,364
"Re: Blaine, Missouri's
150th anniversary...

588
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:59,368
"And the debut of your original musical, red,
white and Blaine.

589
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,704
"The Oppenheimer
organization...

590
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,914
"Is delighted
to inform you...

591
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,463
That it will be sending
a representative,

592
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:09,854
Mr. Mort Guffman,
to view the production

593
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,043
And enlighten us
with his comments."

594
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,756
- How about that?
- "We thank you for the invitation."

595
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:20,595
And it says, "Best regards,
Samuel Oppenheimer, Jr."

596
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,561
Wow! What does
this mean, Corky?

597
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,807
What it means is,

598
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,065
We may be goin'
to Broadway!

599
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,067
Oh! Oh!
This is great news!

600
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,157
How about that?
Did you hear?

601
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,582
My aunt... I brought out
her atlas that I look at a lot...

602
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,911
This big, blue book...
and opened up to "New York."

603
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,087
And it's an island
is really what it is.

604
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,838
It's this island...
Full of people...

605
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,428
Of different colors
and different ideas.

606
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,256
And I can't... it sounds
like a lot of fun to me.

607
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,638
You know, we don't see
much of that...

608
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,556
In Blaine.

609
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,000
I'd like to maybe
meet some guys and...

610
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,816
Italian guys or...

611
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,277
You know, I've
watched TV and stuff.

612
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,863
I'm gonna be glad to do
the show on Broadway.

613
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,408
And there'll probably be other offers.
Keepin' our fingers crossed.

614
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,454
But I don't know if the theater
and the stage is for me.

615
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,078
For one thing,
there's an awful lot of memorizing of lines.

616
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:28,128
- And I think you know what I'm thinkin'.
- Yeah. That's in the way.

617
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,126
Hollywood.

618
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,132
Uh, even when I was a kid
doin' my impressions.

619
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,677
"Here's lookin'
at you, babe," and, uh,

620
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,758
"You don't c-care
about anyone but yourself."

621
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,433
Who was it?

622
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,728
Henry Fonda. I always
tell her who I'm doin'.

623
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,805
She always laughs and says,
"Now who is that?"

624
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,266
Back there, there's always
the germ in my mind...

625
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,943
- That I'd end up on the silver screen.
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,320
You've got the face
for it too, darlin'.

627
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,190
I want to try that
"less is more" kind of acting,

628
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,819
Where when you're talking to someone,
you close your eyes.

629
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,496
And then you look at them when you're not talking to the person.

630
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,706
I mean, open your eyes
when you're looking away.

631
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,160
When you talk to the person,
you go like that.

632
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,213
Never open your eyes
when talking to them.

633
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,914
The Guffman news
is really big.

634
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,304
That the cast
understand how big.

635
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,180
They don't know
the New York thing.

636
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,429
They haven't been
through it, and I have.

637
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,806
So it is kind of
on my shoulders.

638
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:30,436
And going to the big apple
for the first time,

639
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,190
You know, is such an experience,
you never forget it.

640
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,112
It stays with you
for your whole life.

641
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,029
Me, you know, right out of the navy,
you know, fresh off a destroyer,

642
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:44,158
Uh, with a dance belt and
a tube of chap stick, basically.

643
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,330
Not really much
to call my own.

644
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,247
And then basically
being slammed down...

645
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,669
For ten or so years.

646
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,088
You know,
off-off-off-off-broadway.

647
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,792
And then enough is enough,
okay? I get the joke.

648
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,095
And is that gonna happen again?
I don't know.

649
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,755
I don't want it
to happen again.

650
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,218
In my deepest, deepest of hearts,
I do not want it to happen again.

651
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,475
Mr. Guffman brings
with him... A reputation,

652
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,271
Something bigger than anyone
in this town has ever known.

653
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,905
And if I am to get back
to New York City on my terms,

654
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,153
I cannot deliver him...
A stinky product.

655
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,120
I really have to be
presenting him...

656
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,744
A package,
a beautifully wrapped,

657
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,326
Glossy,
sweet-smelling show.

658
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,417
What I need from you,

659
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,750
Because you're the bosses
of the town, essentially...

660
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,255
And I know that... is...

661
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,337
This is so hard.

662
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,673
I mean, there's nothing
easy about this.

663
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,478
This is like when you're gettin' your legs waxed,
and they whip that thing off real fast.

664
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,805
That's what this is like.

665
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,108
I need more money.

666
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,269
How much do you need?

667
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,195
- How much?
- Steve's right. How much are you thinkin'?

668
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,360
Okay.

669
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,862
What I need...

670
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,700
Is $100,000.

671
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,625
- Oh, brother!
- Corky!

672
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,253
You know, he is good.

673
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,510
Let me explain.
Let me explain what...

674
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,715
Oh, man, my heart stopped
for a second there.

675
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,101
All right,
let me explain what that entails.

676
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,099
I bought it all the way,
by the way.

677
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,230
- He's serious.
- He's not kiddin'.

678
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,819
Corky, our entire budget
for the entire year...

679
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,990
Is $15,000 for everything,
and that includes swimming.

680
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,827
I don't have swimmin' in my show.
- No, I mean the pool.

681
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,530
We have to keep up the pool.
That's everything. The entire year is $15,000.

682
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,162
- We have a manager...
- $100,000?

683
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,536
Look, you're a nice fellow.
We're glad you're here.

684
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:00,374
But if I may be blunt,
what's wrong with you?

685
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,421
So what I'm understanding here,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

686
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,054
Is that you're not givin' me
any money.

687
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,514
So now I'm left
basically with nothin'.

688
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,940
I'm left with zero. And which,
and which, what can I do with zero?

689
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,351
You know, what can I...
I can't do anythin' with it.

690
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,732
I need... this is my life here we're talkin' about.

691
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,815
We're not talkin' about, you know,
somethin' else. We're talkin' about my life.

692
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,985
You know?
And it's forcing me to do something I don't wanna do.

693
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,617
To leave.
T-to go out and just leave...

694
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,825
And go home and, say,
make a clean cut here.

695
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,411
And say, "No way, Corky.
You're not puttin' up with these people."

696
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,293
And I'll tell you why
I can't put up with you people.

697
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,340
Because you're bastard people.

698
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,714
That's what you are.
You're just bastard people.

699
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,674
And I'm goin' home,
and I'm gonna bite my pillow is what I'm gonna do.

700
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,561
Now what do you use on your skin?
- Vaseline.

701
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,769
- You use petroleum jelly on your skin?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

702
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,937
- You are getting away with murder, Libby.
- What do you mean?

703
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,693
You're young, and it's okay, but...
- Libby.

704
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,274
Have I told you about... hi.
- Libby, I have an announcement.

705
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,450
- I have to talk to you. I'm gonna have to talk to you.
- Have I told you about...

706
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,869
- Excuse me, Libby, I have to talk to you.
- All right.

707
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,493
- I'm gonna round this up.
- Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

708
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,415
- Dr. Pearl. Good morning.
- Good morning.

709
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,246
- We have an announcement. We have to talk, okay?
- All right.

710
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,045
Gather around, please.
Gather around.

711
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,218
Libby, Sheila,
excuse me. Ron.

712
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,504
Thank you. Dr. Pearl.
Please, be quiet.

713
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,760
I have an announcement.
We've gotta listen up here.

714
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,092
- Excuse me. Are we gonna be vocalizing?
- Okay, listen up.

715
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,473
- We will be vocalizing.
- Before we start, I'd like to clear my throat.

716
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,225
Good.

717
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:43,356
Yes, we'll be vocalizing.
We'll be doing a lot of... excuse me, please!

718
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,068
Everybody, let's be serious now
just for a moment.

719
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,906
And let's all listen up,
okay?

720
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,160
Corky has left the show,
and I am taking over.

721
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:58,497
What I want to do today is start with some music,
do dancing and work on our lines.

722
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,085
And my hope is
at the end of five days,

723
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,546
- What do you mean?
- We will know what we're doing, and we will have a show.

724
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,792
- Corky's left?
- You mean, he's left for today or permanently?

725
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,172
Corky's quit the show,
and it's my show.

726
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,839
Corky!
- Cork!

727
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,846
Corky!

728
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,774
- Here, you go up.
- Boy, do that twice a day. That's good exercise.

729
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,018
- Corky!
- Most athletic injuries... is he not answering?

730
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,025
Corky, we love you!
- Corky, open up!

731
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,823
Corky, we love you.
We want you to live.

732
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,194
- There may be something wrong. Try the door again.
- Oh, God. It's us.

733
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,458
- He wants to be alone right now.
- I can't forgive myself if something was wrong.

734
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:52,045
Just shut up! Just shut up!
Jesus Christ!

735
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,183
Crazy people, my God!

736
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,851
I know how he feels too.

737
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,644
I guess I can just go back
to the Dairy Queen, you know.

738
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,320
They said they'd take me back.

739
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,488
I always have a place
at the Dairy Queen.

740
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,829
You gotta stop cryin'.

741
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:25,378
She hasn't cried this much since the day we got married, honestly.

742
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,214
You know,
this is wonderful.

743
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,590
Why didn't I react like this when I was
playing football for the Blaine panthers...

744
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,796
And our quarterback went down
with a dislocated knee.

745
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,674
- I should've said, "time-out."
- 'Cause you're strong, Ron. You're strong.

746
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,759
- You're just a big brick.
- Oh, let's delay the game.

747
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,013
And my lip would tremble,
and I'd say we have an injured quarterback.

748
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,268
Let's give up. No!
You know what we did?

749
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,316
We brought in
the second-string quarterback.

750
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,398
When he went down, we brought in
the third-string quarterback.

751
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,363
And we went on,
and we whipped the pants off of Harry Truman high school.

752
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,697
And next week,
went out and mopped the floor with blessed heart of Mary.

753
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,370
And they went on to win
the state championship.

754
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,626
To tell you the truth,
I haven't even thought about it, not for a...

755
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,379
Not for a second have I dwelled on the fact that the show's over.

756
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,259
I don't, uh, I don't, uh, think about it.
I try not to think about it.

757
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,885
And therefore,
I, you know, don't,

758
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:23,391
Because it's a very healthy way to deal with something that is very...

759
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,688
Ultimately, not that important
in the long run.

760
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,892
It's not, not, uh,
not important at all,

761
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,773
You know, for me.

762
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,324
I'm just so sad for Corky,
you know.

763
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,324
I mean, I think these creative people,
they're real emotional.

764
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,582
And, um,
I think the important thing about show biz people is...

765
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,455
That you gotta have
another life.

766
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,913
And I know, you know, uh,
he-he-he's got a wife.

767
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:55,048
I guess she's out of town, uh,
because I haven't seen her ln...

768
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:59,302
I've never seen her, so, you know,
that could be the problem.

769
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,758
You know, maybe she's just
not supportive.

770
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,136
Corky, without you,
there's no show.

771
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,224
Without the show,
there's no celebration.

772
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,643
Without celebration,
there's no Blaine.

773
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,021
So, you see how
it's a domino effect.

774
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,444
You know how
dominoes do that.

775
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,272
Without Blaine, I got news for you,
there's no Missouri.

776
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,652
Blaine is the heart
of Missouri.

777
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,077
What happens if Missouri goes down?
You tell me.

778
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,952
We need the magic back in the show is what we need.

779
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,329
And it ain't gonna happen
with Lloyd.

780
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:32,505
Lloyd is a music teacher, and he shops at Wal-Mart.
He doesn't even support the town.

781
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:37,882
But the person who needs you most is Blaine Fabin.
- Hear, hear.

782
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,348
- And I'm not just saying that because I am a Fabin.
- Okay, okay.

783
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,551
I'm saying that
because I just know...

784
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,934
That nobody
can touch, um,

785
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,106
That whole...
Thing.

786
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,859
That whole thing.
Hmm?

787
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,777
You could take a nickel,
and you could make it into a million dollars,

788
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,233
Because this man is a genius,
and we cannot lose that.

789
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,614
Look what you did with Barefoot when you came to this town.

790
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,287
Did you have any budget then? You didn't have $100,000 then.
- Barefoot was a perfect show.

791
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,240
- And look what happened to that show.
- Great show.

792
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,328
And what about Backdraft? You took a little cellophane,
and you made it into flames.

793
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,922
- You could still feel the heat.
- You know what? You're not wrong.

794
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,127
We need you to take your magic wand and wave it.

795
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,885
And make this town special again is what we need.

796
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,800
Will you do it?

797
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,932
Please. Please.
- Come on back, cork.

798
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,955
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

799
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,748
Please. Oh!

800
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,669
All right. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

801
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,251
Thank you.
Okay.

802
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,126
Let's pretend that it
never happened, okay?

803
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,507
And let's just jump into
"Covered wagons."

804
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,928
- All right, let's start from the dance part, all right?
- "Covered wagons."

805
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:20,313
in a funny way,
what the city council did was really give me a challenge.

806
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,234
And it's a challenge
that I am going to accept.

807
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,536
It's like in the olden days,
in the days in France,

808
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,497
When men would slap each other
with their gloves,

809
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,160
And say, you know,
"D'Artagnan," you know,

810
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,245
"How dare you talk to me
like that, you?"

811
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,164
And smack him.

Specs?

824
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,086
1845, You know,
I think,

825
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:26,054
it's a little problem.
- Oh! Oh-oh, oh-oh.

826
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,215
- My glasses?
- Yeah.

827
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,517
You're saying, l ca...
- I don't think you should wear them.

828
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,971
Don't wear them in the show?
- It's mostly in "Covered wagons."

829
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:39,480
Because I think that that's the one where it's just not as believable.

830
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,687
Of course,
when you get further up in time,

831
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,944
- Historically, it's...
- I-I can see a couple of problems,

832
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,158
Nothing major,
and nothing that we can't solve.

833
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:53,240
Uh, one, uh,
contrary to public opinion,

834
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:57,085
I don't see very well,
uh, without my glasses.

835
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,788
So, you know, I'm thinking,
is that going to be a problem for me?

836
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,794
Just... Look out.

837
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:07,713
And the other thing, which,
uh, is also a problem, is...

838
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,390
I have a very lazy eye,

839
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,816

I can get off like that.

845
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,879
But the, uh...
where I'm having a problem is...

846
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:46,129
Sometimes the horse comes out,
and I can't get past the cow.

847
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,927
So, I have to, kinda, you know,
do this when I come out,

848
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,222
"Gather 'round
for I have news."

849
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,267
I don't know which is more lifelike,
the horse or Dr. Pearl.

850
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:57,845
You.

851
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,602
Corky, here's the phone.

852
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,853
It's Johnny.

853
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,820
Hello. Yeah.

854
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,274
What do you mean?

855
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,234
- Then we back up.
- So wait 'til we turn around to you.

856
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,238
What do you mean? What do you mean?
What are you saying?

857
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:21,878
I understand that. No, I understand.
Believe me, I do understand.

858
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,507
What you can do is just say,
"Absolutely not."

859
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
Do you understand that?

860
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,802
I-I don't believe that.
No, I'm sorry.

861
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,178
I do not accept that.
That is not an answer. No.

862
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:38,720
It's absolutely unacceptable that you would say this now.
Not today.

863
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:39,808
No!

864
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,065
And that's the...
that's the way it is?

865
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,987
Then I just hate you,
and I hate your "ass face."

866
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,357
Oh, Corky.

867
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,450
- What's up?
- Johnny's not in the show.

868
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,654
His dad said he has to go back to work.
He's not in the show.

869
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,618
What does he
think this is, school?

870
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,699
That he can be
marked absent one day?

871
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,045
This is the day of the show, y'all.
- Oh, my God.

872
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,873
- Just, just...
- This is very strange.

873
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,085
Ron, j-j-just let me think
for a second, all right?

874
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,545
I've just got to take
a breath here...

875
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,756
And try to figure this out,
all right?

876
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,812
- It's tight. That hurts.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

877
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,767
Okay, you know what? If you could hike it up a bit,
you'd get a little more room.

878
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,271
Yeah, well, I am
pulling them up.

879
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,730
I'm sort of trying to commit to one side here, dear.
- This is Johnny's costume.

880
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:35,535
And Johnny is a lot... you know,
he's a different body type than you are.

881
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,987
This is... I'm worried because this won't...

882
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,414
- I'm about five inches away...
- I understand.

883
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,663
Actors, we're at fifteen minutes.

884
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,994
We're at fifteen.

885
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:49,423
No, no, no, we gotta move now. Come on.
Come on. You're gonna have to help me here.

886
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,751
- You gotta help me here.
- Wait. Okay.

887
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,846
- I'm so nervous tonight, ron.
- You're gonna be great. You're gonna be great.

888
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,273
- And if there's an empty space, just say a line.
- Yeah.

889
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,726
That's what I like to do,
even if it's from another show.

890
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,526
Agnes, where's
the lilac dress?

891
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,236
- You mean, the purple one?
- Yes, where is it?

892
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,041
Honey, I told you to lay off the hot fudge sundaes.
I couldn't let the seams out.

893
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,335
- What? It's not here? Agnes.
- No, it is not. Hello, sweetheart.

894
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:44,520
- Oh, I just dried my makeup.
- Hark, a rider approaches.

895
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,644
Oh, god!
- That's all right. Just... careful.

896
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,356
- I hope that isn't too hot.
- No, no, it's just fine.

897
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,563
May I remind you, please?
No glasses for the first number, all right?

898
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,444
Oh, no. No, no.
I didn't forget.

899
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,616
Actors, we're at places.

900
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,278
Have a good show, everybody.
Break a leg.

901
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,741
- Don't worry about anything 'cause it's gonna all roll...
- He's not here.

902
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,443
- What?
- He's not here.

903
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,278
Guffman?
- Not here?

904
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,034
Okay, okay, look.
- Should we lower the curtain?

905
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,332
Corky?
- No, no, no. Everybody, look, look, look.

906
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,160
I've been through this
a million times.

907
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,371
These New York types
like to come late.

908
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,005
Believe me,
I've never seen one of them come on time in all my years in the theater.

909
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,505
- Take a deep breath.
- Good.

910
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,970
Blow it out.
He's gonna be here.

911
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,845
Let's just do a good show.
Everybody do a good show.

912
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:46,925
Hands in the middle.

913
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,963
Oh, howdy!

914
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,976
I didn't see you
sneak up on me there.

915
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,522
But if you'd like,
you're welcome to share my campfire with me.

916
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,146
I was just fixin'
to get me some grub.

917
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,269
Beans.

918
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,525
I love beans.

919
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,404
Big, fat, hot, juicy beans.

920
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,153
Now don't get me goin'
on beans,

921
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,451
Or I'll be jabberin' away
'til the sun comes up.

922
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,080
But, you know,
now that I've got your ear,

923
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,958
There is a story I wouldn't mind
sharin' with ya.

924
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:02,088
It's a tall tale that grows taller with each passing year.

925
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,296
It's the story of Blaine.

926
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,396
Well, we've traveled
long and far today.

927
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,231
We must let the women
and children rest.

928
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,284
Don't you rest on our account,
Daniel Potter.

929
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,035
We women are just as strong
and resilient as you men.

930
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,243
I do believe ya are, Rebecca.
I do believe ya are.

931
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,871
California will be a sight
for these weary eyes.

932
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,252
Mine as well, Rebecca,
mine as well.

933
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,925
But right now,
we need a campfire to warm our souls...

934
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,595
- And to cook our food.
- Done.

935
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:57,060
- That will be quite enough of that, Billy Whitaker.
- Just one kiss.

936
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,768
There will be plenty of time for kissin' when we get to California.

937
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,444
If we get
to California.

938
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,067
Oh, we'll get there.

939
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,196
Blaine Fabin
will lead us there.

940
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,536
Hark, a rider approaches.

941
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,534
Blaine Fabin
returns.

942
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:17,626
Whoa! Hello there.

943
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,332
Whoa! Steady.

944
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,383
Gather 'round,
for I have news.

945
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,758
What news?
What did your keen and perceptive eyes behold?

946
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,054
Just up yonder,
there is a ridge.

947
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,886
And how high a ridge,
I could not tell.

948
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,649
For the sun had set and darkness fell before I reached its pinnacle.

949
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:44,236
Then a strange thing
happened.

950
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,444
My nose
started twitchin'.

951
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,068
There is a mysterious scent
in the night air.

952
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:55,115
- What kind of scent?
- What was this mysterious scent?

953
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:59,043
It was the scent
of saltwater.

954
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,961
- Saltwater?
- Hub-hub, hub-hub, hub-hub.

955
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,966
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have reached our destination.

956
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,839
We have reached
the pacific.

957
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:13,091

Sixty years went by and the town of
Blaine kept a-growin' and a-changin'.

965
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:38,972
Every time you looked around,
a new house was goin' up, a new family was movin' in.

966
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,888
- Oh, hurry, Agnes.
- Oh, I am trying to hurry. There we go.

00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:47,192
You got my hat?
- Your hat? Right here's your hat, darling.

968
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,280
McGillicutty's orchard became
the Blaine elementary school.

969
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:56,535
They even laid track for that newfangled invention,
the iron horse,

970
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,864
Which brought a pretty important visitor to Blaine.

971
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:04,372
Yea!
It's president McKinley.

972
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:11,508
Good people of Blaine,
they told me my next stop was Wichita.

973
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,964
But I said,
"What about Blaine?"

974
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,467
Hurrah! Hurrah!

975
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,844
I guess I need
a new travel agent.

976
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:25,515
Mr. President,
in honor of our visit...

977
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,726
Your visit...
to our town,

978
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:33,815
I present you humbly with this fair key to our city.

979
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:38,744
Well, I do declare,
I believe the key to the city is larger than the city itself.

980
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,906
Wait, Mr. President.

981
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,536
- Well, what have we here?
- It's a footstool. I make them.

982
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,332
Well, isn't that interesting?

983
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,372
I'll take this back
to Washington with me.

984
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,964
And every time I rest my feet,
I'll think of Blaine.

985
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:05,179
Now we all know that politicians aren't used to keepin' their word.

986
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,017
He's here.
- Who's here?

987
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,724
- He's here.
- He's here. I told you.

988
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,982
Should we start over again?
Let's do "Covered wagons" again.

989
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,438
Well, before you know it,

990
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:19,743
Everyone, rich and poor alike,
had to have a Blaine stool in their home.

991
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,204
The little town
never knew what hit it.

992
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:27,035
Footstool factories sprouted up like, uh,
like toadstools.

993
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,793
Everyone had a good job.
Everyone was makin' a good wage.

994
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,876

Phew!

1019
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,886
I can't wait
to see the second half.

1020
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,975
Allan, his dramatic work.
I mean, I knew he was funny.

1021
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:52,600
And I knew he could, you know, move, dance,
'cause he's, he's that way.

1022
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:57,939
But I think his dramatical work
is so moving that, uh, well.

1023
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,527
I mean, I called Joyce,
and I said,

1024
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:03,782
"Joyce, bring Joshy,
'cause I gotta feed him halftime because I'm just busting."

1025
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,655
This is good.
Boy, they're movin'.

1026
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,036
They're dancin' all over the place.
And the songs are very catchy.

1027
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,865
Uh, very catchy.
I can't get a few of 'em out of my head.

1028
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,170
It's almost to annoying point,
but I think it's good when a song is catchy...

1029
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,837
From the little experience
I have in show business.

1030
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,716
You know, I knew that Corky could act,
and he could direct, and he could produce.

1031
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,385
But who knew that he was gonna act and sing and dance?

1032
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,887
You know, he can just do
everything there is to do.

1033
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,594
And there's only one other person in the world that can do that,

1034
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,229
And that's Barbra Streisand.

1035
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:40,436
He is, uh... I don't know...
an inspiration to this town.

1036
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,690
That's what he is.

1037
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,950
And I for one am very glad to see that
Johnny Savage dropped out of the show.

1038
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,699
Because a couple of years ago
he came in the drugstore,

1039
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,325
And he tried to steal
my stamp machine.

1040
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,414
And that kid is no good.

1041
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,955
You could tell just by his parents he's no good.

1042
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,204
And he would not have added
anything to the show.

1043
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,206
Where Corky, on the other hand...
look at him. Did you see...

1044
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,337
God, I wish I was
in the show!

1045
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,408
I hear that French girls
are very pretty,

1046
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,153
That they wear
the finest of clothes.

1047
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:35,749
I also hear that they are experts in the ways of love.

1048
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,999
Ima, I'm going to fight
for my country.

1049
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,627
To fight,
and yes, perhaps, die,

1050
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:46,425
so that young men
from here to Timbuktu

1051
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:49,967
can feel the wind of freedom
blowing through their hair.

1052
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,217
Oh, Monty, I didn't mean
to doubt you.

1053
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:58,810
It's just sometimes I feel
as if I don't really know you.

1054
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,397

- There it is. There it is.

1070
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,492

1080
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,441
Oh, you were right.
- You lifted me up!

1081
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,482
Yes, after our brave fighting boys returned from the war,

1082
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,735
Things got back
to normal in Blaine,

1083
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,201
Until one summer night
in 1946,

1084
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,335
When unexpected visitors
put us back on the map.

1085
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,083
- Where are we?
- How did we get here?

1086
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,090
Is this a dream?

1087
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,804
Look, what is it?

1088
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,227
I don't know.
It looks like one of them new feed storage bins.

1089
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,180
That ain't
no feed storage bin.

1090
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,483
- How did it get here?
- It must've flew.

1091
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,231
But it don't have
any wings.

1092
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:54,273
Then I guess it just dropped
from somewhere up there.

1093
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:58,660
Citizens of Blaine,
do not be alarmed.

1094
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,612
We will not harm you.

1095
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,783
We come in peace
from a planet far, far away.

1096
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,460
A place we call Mars.

1097
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,038
- I've heard of Mars.
- Where's that?

1098
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:13,546
Stand back and your
queries will be answered.

1099
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,968
Look out!

1100
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:29,853
- What do you want from us?
- Hey, good question, earthling.

1101
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,608
It seemed like it was time for a change,
time to take a trip...

1102
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,400
To see the exciting places
in the galaxy.

1103
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,951

1115

Well, the town of Blaine has packed a lot in the last 150 years.

1116
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,128
We've had our ups,
and we've had our downs.

1117
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,966
We've seen our past,
and we look forward to the future.

1118
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,633
And when the challenges come,
we'll greet 'em the way Americans always do:

1119
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,685
With grit, determination
and pride.

1120
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:52,023
Because that, my friends,
is America.

1121
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,984
And nothin' says
America more to me...

1122
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,194
Than Blaine!

1123
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,341
Corky! Corky!

1124
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,097
- You were good.
- You are so brilliant. You're brilliant.

1125
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,350
Cliff, you're great.
Everyone was so great.

1126
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,557
- Oh, Dr. Pearl!
- Oh, man.

1127
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,608
- Corky, you did it!
- Oh, thank you.

1128
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,445
I'm gonna get Mr. Guffman. I'll be right backstage.
- Okay.

1129
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,367
That was great.

1130
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,992
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.

1131
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,746
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

1132
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,456
- Boffo socko, Corky.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you.

1133
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,130
- Wait'll they hear about this at the next mayor's conference.
- Thank you so much.

1134
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,586
Well, I know we have
a lot of work to do.

1135
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,259
The first act needs...

1136
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,757
- It was magical. God!
- Thank you very much, Steve.

1137
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,213
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

1138
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,009
We've got the first act again.
It's just, you know, it's up and down.

1139
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,760
Kind of dippin' and that,
and I know that.

1140
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,971
- We don't have the time to do everything.
- Yeah.

1141
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,230
So, I'm gonna ask you
point-blank.

1142
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,686
- Do we have a shot to go to Broadway?
- Yes, I think so.

1143
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,815
Oh, oh, mama mia.
Oh, that is such good news.

1144
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,990
I can't tell you
what news that is to me.

1145
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,319
- Would you like to meet the cast?
- I'd like that. Yeah.

1146
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,952
Oh, great.
Come on with me, you.

1147
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,296
- That Blaine babe and I...
- Everybody!

1148
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,087
Yes!

1149
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:32,430
- Our cast.
- Thank you. You were just great.

1150
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,477
Well, I'd like...
please, introduce yourselves.

1151
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,649
Sheila.
Sheila Albertson.

1152
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,602
- You were great.
- I was?

1153
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,609
Mrs. Ron Albertson. I'm Ron Albertson.
A pleasure performing...

1154
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,069
This came
a couple of hours ago.

1155
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,823
- I'm sorry. I'm just now getting it to you.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

1156
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,204
Clifford Wooley. Nice to meet you.
- Mr. Wooley.

1157
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,999
- Allan Pearl.
- You make me laugh.

1158
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,873
Oh, oh.
It's a delight to meet you, sir.

1159
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:04,962
Well, I'm sure that Mr.
Guffman would like to say a few words to us.

1160
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:08,762
Hear, hear.
- Speech, speech, speech.

1161
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,179
Well, I think there's
some mistake.

1162
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,555
My name is Loomis, Roy Loomis.
I'm down from Deming.

1163
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,682
I came down.
My niece had her first baby.

1164
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,731
Uh, it's a boy, and
that's what the balloon is for.

1165
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:25,445
I just wanted to tell you how absolutely wonderful you all were.

1166
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,231
And, uh, thank you.

1167
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,113
And, uh, I'll be seeing ya
and bless you.

1168
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,742
He's gonna love this.
Oh, boy.

1169
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,795
Take our, uh, makeup off.

1170
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,190
"Snowstorm in New York.

1171
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,239
"All flights canceled.

1172
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,193
Mort Guffman."

1173
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,434
I think the one really
important thing that I learned,

1174
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,480
Uh, from my whole experience
in working with Corky...

1175
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:48,983
Is that I do
indeed have talent.

1176
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,111
And a couple of things,
actually.

1177
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:58,204
B: I have to entertain.

1178
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,031
I have to entertain.

1179
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:04,369
And you have to go
where you are needed.

1180
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,500
You have to go
where the crowds are.

1181
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,714
And you have to go...

1182
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:12,381
Where the love is.

1183
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:17,257
And the love for me,
right now, is in Miami,

1184
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,883
Not Blaine.

1189
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,482

in the land of dreams.

1190
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,486
And don't let anybody tell you
dreams can't come true.

1191
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,327
- We're an hour from the snow.
- Uh-huh.

1192
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,409
- We're twenty minutes from the ocean.
- Uh-huh.

1193
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,532
- Two hours from the Mexico.
- Uh-huh.

1194
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,165
- Five hours from Vegas.
- Uh, five hours from Las Vegas.

1195
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,371
- And we're gonna get there one of these days. Yeah.
- Soon as we get a car.

1196
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,458
We don't have a car yet.
Who wants to add to the pollution?

1197
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,292
We consider ourselves
bi-coastal...

1198
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,049
If you consider the Mississippi river one of the coasts.

1199
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,048
Uh...
- Extras, let's go. Over here.

1200
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,055
All right. Time to get back to work.
That's what they're payin' us for.

1201
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,353
- Come on, kid.
- Why can't they refer to us by name?

1202
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:08,437
Why can't they say, "Ron, Sheila,
over this way, please"?

1203
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,860
Still the same on the paycheck. Hi, how ya doin'?
- All right.

1204
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,778
You're doin' a great job, incidentally.

1205
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,069
- Smile.
- Are you gonna smile?

1206
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,030
I think we should
have a line.

1207
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,536
I gave him some suggestions.
He didn't want to hear it. He's busy.

1208
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,746
- Line dancing. We should be line dancing.
- That's a great idea.

1209
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,745
Quiet, please.
All right.

1210
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,745
Put your finger up like this. Are you smilin'?
- Quiet, please.

1211
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:35,002
I was on my way to New York,
and then my dad got out of prison,

1212
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,710
Which is good.

1213
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,554
He was supposed to be
in there for ten years,

1214
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,133
But, I guess, since he
didn't kill anybody...

1215
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:46,100
And just
ruined some property...

1216
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,765
That, um, they let him out
after five.

1217
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,606
So, it's...
I'm here with my dad,

1218
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,566
And, uh...

1219
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,617
I've been thinkin' of ice cream and stuff and what I can do with it.

1220
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,742
Maybe come up with... we have a blizzard,
and we have a breeze.

1221
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,784
We have derbies,
and the derbies are really old.

1222
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,707
They've been doin' derbies,
you know, the chocolate dipped,

1223
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,630
For, I think,
twenty years or somethin'.

1224
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,552
I really wanna
sort of make a healthy,

1225
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,925
Low-fat or nonfat,
uh, healthy...

1226
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:27,894
Blizzard.

1227
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:33,526
The first thing I did when
I moved back to New York City...

1228
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,524
Was to look up Mr. Guffman.

1229
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,943
And he was so sweet.

1230
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,278
And I think he felt
a little guilty too,

1231
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:44,908
Because he's offered me the chance to
audition for his new Broadway show,

1232
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,661
Which is a revival
of My Fair Lady.

1233
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,163
It's one of my favorite shows
of all time.

1234
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,708
And the role is
of Henry Higgins,

1235
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,799
The somewhat
stern taskmaster,

1236
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,468
But he-really-likes-her-anyway-
kind-of-thing guy,

1237
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,881
Who teaches Eliza
how to speak correctly.

1238
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:07,514
And she, of course,
is of the cockney persuasion and drops her H's.

1239
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,938
And I've been workin' on that at home,
the whole cockney thing of,

1240
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,560
"'ello, 'ow are 'oo?

1241
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:17,942
Do you want to go to 'artford?
Not live in this 'ell 'ole" and that kind of thing.

1242
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,399
I think I'm honing in on it
pretty close now.

1243
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:25,865
And I suppose that the "cake and eat it too" part of this whole story is...

1244
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,164
That another dream of mine
has come true,

1245
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:31,959
Which is, I've gotten
to open this shop,

1246
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:37,211
Where I have all my show business treasures and all my memorabilia.

1247
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,919
This is, without a doubt,
one of my favorite items,

1248
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:44,130
Uh, my dinner with Andre
action figures.

1249
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,183
And what you can do,
which is so cute,

1250
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,932
Is, uh, you can reenact
the whole scene,

1251
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:56,188
You know, where the two guys talk to each other,
and say, you know,

1252
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,896
"Boy, I'm sure glad you've
found a good restaurant.

1253
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,772
It's so hard these days
to get in."

1254
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,277
You know,
"Who do you know?"

1255
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:08,238
"Oh, I just called, made a call,
spur of the moment."

1256
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,367
"Oh, you. You can always
get a reservation."

1257
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,119
You know, that's not
from the movie,

1258
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,042
But you can make up
your own dialogue,

1259
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,210
Which is one of the great things
about action figures.

1260
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,468
I'm trying to get...
it's very rare...

1261
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,301
The one... the action figures for Das Boot,

1262
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,925
'Cause I love to do
that whole, you know,

1263
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,010
Kind of claustrophobic thing
inside the sub,

1264
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,390
Where they're, you know...

1265
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,349
you know,
that whole German thing.

1266
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,776
Can't speak German,
but it sounds like, uh, you know,

1267
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:41,104
Sort of a bunch of
barnyard animals...

1268
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,315
Mach-mach-mach-mach... you know,
making that noise and sweatin'.

1269
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,994
Uh, over here,
these are my big heads,

1270
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,289
I call' em, starting with
Anthony Michael Hall,

1271
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,124
One of the "brat packers."

1272
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:59,167
In fact,
there's... in the background there... there's Andrew McCarthy.

1273
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,042
Over here is some new lunch boxes we've gotten in.

1274
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,503
They're Remains of the Day
lunch box.

1275
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,430
And the kids,
they're just havin' such a good time with these.

1276
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,600
You know, kids don't like
eating lunch at school,

1277
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:15,976
But if they've got a Remains of the Day lunch box,
they're a whole lot happier.
