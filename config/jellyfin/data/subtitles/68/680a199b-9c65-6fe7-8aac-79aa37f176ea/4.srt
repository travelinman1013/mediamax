1
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:22,473
First of all,

2
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:24,976
i want to thank
everybody for coming.

3
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:26,477
Giving up your lunch hours
and all that.

4
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:29,480
And, lord knows,
very exciting for all of us.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,481
Happy to be here.

6
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,482
Oh, me, too.

7
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,484
Absolutely. And let's just
get our hands right into it.

8
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:34,485
Who wants to start us off?

9
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:35,987
I'll be
happy to start.

10
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:37,488
You know what? Gwen,
why don't you start us off?

11
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,489
Ok. Sure...

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,490
you don't need
the pointer here, do you?

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,992
No. I don't need
the pointer. Thanks.

14
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:41,993
I'll just hold on
to it, then.

15
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:42,994
Oh, she's fine. Gwen?

16
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,495
There is
a concern that i have

17
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,997
that i think
needs addressing

18
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:47,999
is that we can't have
the port-a-potties

19
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,500
too far off
the main route,

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,002
because we do have
a lot of seniors.

21
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:53,004
Uh, we've solved that.

22
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,505
We're gonna take
the port-a-potties

23
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:56,007
and put 'em
right over here.

24
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,508
They're not gonna
be in the way.

25
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,010
We're gonna
put a receptacle

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,511
over near
arts and crafts.

27
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:02,513
This is the big bins
you're talking about?

28
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:04,015
We've got barrels, too.

29
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:06,017
And we're gonna put
the barrels on every corner.

30
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,518
Wait a minute.
That's... that's the crate?

31
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,020
That's the big
barrel, 'cause you got

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,022
the pie-eating going on
right over here.

33
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:12,523
It's more of a dumpster
than a barrel.

34
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,524
That's another thing.
If anything happens

35
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,026
like last year
with that pie-eating...

36
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:18,529
which brings me
to a point... security.

37
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:19,530
Oh, god.

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,034
Security. I say
we put a rifle on here,

39
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:26,037
a man with a rifle here,
and a rifle here.

40
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,038
Protect the whole square.

41
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,039
Is that really
necessary?

42
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,541
Yes. Remember how much
we got egged last year?

43
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,542
Absolutely.

44
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,045
What can i tell you?
We're pleased as punch.

45
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,047
We... we are so proud.

46
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,049
We know that
whatever we do here

47
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,051
is a first for blaine
and a first for missouri,

48
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,053
that whatever we do
is going to be the standard

49
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:45,556
against which all other
sesquicentennials...

50
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,559
that's the 150...
will be judged.

51
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,562
The people of blaine
are can-do people.

52
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,064
In fact, you know, there's
an old saying in missouri

53
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:56,067
if you don't like the weather,
just wait 5 minutes.

54
00:01:56,067 --> 00:02:00,071
In blaine, i honestly
believe with hard work,

55
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:02,073
we can get that down
to 3 or 4 minutes.

56
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:04,492
Here in our
sesquicentennial year,

57
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:05,993
we've got a lot
to talk about.

58
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,495
There's a lot
to be proud of.

59
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,996
And we're very proud
of it,

60
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:09,997
and i think it's about time

61
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,499
that the world
knows more about blaine.

62
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,500
We're chomping at the bit,

63
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,502
certainly from this end,
to get it out there.

64
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:18,506
It all started
with blaine fabin.

65
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,508
He was hired by 30 settlers

66
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:23,511
to lead a wagon-train expedition
from philadelphia to california.

67
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,012
Uh, on the 14th night,

68
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,515
word has it they were
sitting around the campfire,

69
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,017
and blaine said,
"do you smell it?

70
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,019
Do you smell the salt
in the air?"

71
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,021
He said, "we're here.
I brought you to california."

72
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,023
And so there was
a big party that night.

73
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,526
And the next morning,
they got up. Uh...

74
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,027
they didn't see the ocean

75
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,530
because they were in missouri.

76
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,033
Uh, blaine was able to convince
them for a little while

77
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,535
that it was just low tide
and things,

78
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,037
but what had happened was
that he had made some mistakes.

79
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,040
Bad weather. Wasrt familiar,
perhaps, with the proper route.

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,041
But as it turns out,

81
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,043
everybody was quite happy
to be where they were.

82
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,045
So they said, "it's ok we didn't
make it to california.

83
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,046
We'll stay here."

84
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,549
And that's why
i'm at this desk.

85
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,052
Well, i'm very proud to say
that i'm a direct descendant

86
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,053
of blaine fabin.

87
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,556
I've lived here all my life.

88
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,058
As did my parents
and their parents

89
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,060
and their parents
and their parents

90
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,562
and so on and so forth.

91
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,565
I'm very excited about
the show coming up,

92
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,567
because it'll be
the first time

93
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,070
i'll have the experience
of sitting in the audience

94
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,575
and seeing actors portray
my ancestor...

95
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,578
the... the actual
blaine fabin.

96
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,081
Being a fabin
is not always easy.

97
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:38,085
Um, i can certainly understand
how the kennedys feel.

98
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,589
I had been
living in new york

99
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,091
and working there
as an actor and director

100
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,594
and choreographer
for 25 years or so,

101
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,096
and i really felt
i needed a change.

102
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,599
I imagined, in my fantasy,
i suppose,

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,101
that when i came here,

104
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,604
i would have a completely
different life.

105
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,607
Uh, perhaps, um...

106
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,108
a construction worker

107
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,610
or one of those guys

108
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,614
that works on those
high-wire things that, uh...

109
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,615
with the hard hat.

110
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,117
You know,
that sweeping sort of hat.

111
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,620
And, uh, with the chaps.

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,122
But that didn't really
work out.

113
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,124
I began to realize, i guess,

114
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,627
that the theater
was still in my blood,

115
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,630
and what i had to do was
make use of that,

116
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,634
so i offered my services
to the high school here,

117
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,135
and they accepted,

118
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,137
and i began to teach drama.

119
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,139
And within about 6 months,

120
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,642
i had formed
the blaine community players.

121
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,643
I got to tell you,

122
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,645
we are very, very excited
about the big show

123
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,147
that's happening
at the end of the festival.

124
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,650
Everyone right now
is just going crazy

125
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,151
getting ready to audition.

126
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,654
And unfortunately
i won't be able to audition.

127
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,657
We have to stock that day
and can't get out of it.

128
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:53,160
And corky will not let me
audition any other time.

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,162
So, "that's show business,"
is what he told me,

130
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,665
and, uh, you know,
he's the master.

131
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,166
You gotta give him credit
for that.

132
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,168
President mckinley
did a whistle-stop tour

133
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,170
back in 1898.

134
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,172
And a little boy,
jimmy mcbean,

135
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,674
made a stool for him.

136
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,176
And he loved it so much
that he called back,

137
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,178
and said, "lookit, i would
like to give more of these

138
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,180
to dignitaries
who are visiting."

139
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,682
And before you knew it,

140
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,686
blaine is manufacturing
all these footstools.

141
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,688
And that's how the big...

142
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,190
that's how we got
the stool boom.

143
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,194
Blaine became the stool capital
of the world.

144
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,322
My first show
wasbarefoot in the park,

145
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,824
which was an absolute smash,

146
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:34,327
but my production
on the stage ofbackdraft

147
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,329
was what really
got them excited.

148
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,333
This whole idea of
in-your-face theater

149
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,335
really affected them.

150
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:44,837
The conceptualization,
the whole abstraction,

151
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,340
the obtuseness
of this production to me

152
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,841
was what was interesting.

153
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:53,346
I wanted the audience
to feel the heat from the fire,

154
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:56,849
the fear... because people
don't like fire poked,

155
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,851
poked in their noses.

156
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,353
You know, when you get
a cinder from barbecue

157
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:01,354
right on the end
of your nose

158
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,856
and you kind of make
that little face.

159
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,358
That's not a good thing.

160
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,860
I wanted to have
the sense memory of that.

161
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,363
So during the show,

162
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,864
i had someone
burn newspapers

163
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,867
and... and send it through
the vents in the theater.

164
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,869
Well, they freaked out.

165
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,372
Of course, the fire marshal
came over,

166
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,874
and they shut us down
for a couple of days.

167
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,376
Mr. Bluestein,

168
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,378
montezuma's revenge
is nothing more

169
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,381
than good old-fashioned
american diarrhea.

170
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,382
Adult diapers

171
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,884
should never even
enter the picture.

172
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:35,388
So you lose
a few pounds.

173
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,390
My mom used to say
that blaine

174
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,392
is a little town
with a big heart

175
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,894
in the heart
of a big country.

176
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,896
And, to me, blaine
is a kind of town

177
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:47,900
where i can have
my own business,

178
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,903
meet and marry a wonderful
woman like sheila,

179
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:54,407
and... and be something,
be somebody.

180
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,409
Some people
find it ironical

181
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,910
that even though
we run a travel agency,

182
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,413
we've never been
outside of blaine.

183
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:01,914
With one exception.

184
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:03,916
Well, we've never
been out...

185
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,418
you left blaine.

186
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:07,420
Well, i went
to jefferson city once.

187
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,421
It was a...

188
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,422
tell them why.

189
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,924
It was a medical reason.

190
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,927
You can tell 'em.

191
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:17,930
Just minor surgery.

192
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,436
I've been
working here at the d.q.

193
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:25,438
For about, um...

194
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,943
8 months, 7.

195
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:32,945
I don't know.
Something like that.

196
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,447
It's fun.

197
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,949
You just do the cones.

198
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,952
Make sundaes,
make blizzards, and...

199
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,454
put stuff on 'em and...

200
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,956
see a lot of people come in.

201
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:45,958
A lot of people
come to the d.q.

202
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,961
Burgers. Ice cream.

203
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,964
Anything, you know?

204
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,467
Cokes. Just drive in
and get a coke,

205
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,969
if you're thirsty.

206
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,972
Everybody thinks that roswell
was the first sighting

207
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,974
of a ufo
in the united states,

208
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,476
and that's bull roar.

209
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,978
We had the first sighting
here in 1946.

210
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:08,481
And it wasrt just a sighting.
They didn't just fly by.

211
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,483
They stopped. They landed.

212
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,485
The people in blaine
went onboard the ship

213
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,487
for a potluck dinner.

214
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,490
I've been coming out
to this landing site

215
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,492
every day for 2 years

216
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:21,494
to measure it.

217
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,496
And here's the thing...

218
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:26,999
the circumference
and the diameter change

219
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,000
by a few inches,

220
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:31,003
yet the radius
remains the same.

221
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,005
Which brings me back
to the number 5.

222
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,509
There are 5 letters
in the name "blaine."

223
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,011
Mix the word "blaine" up,
mix it around,

224
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,514
eventually,
you'll get "nebali."

225
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:44,517
Neball...
the name of the planet

226
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:47,520
in a galaxy way, way...

227
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,522
way... far away.

228
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,023
I'll tell you another thing.

229
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,525
Once you step inside
this circle,

230
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:56,028
The weather never changes.

231
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,031
It is always 67 degrees

232
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,534
with a 40% chance of rain.

233
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,535
Always.

234
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,538
L... i love
to make people laugh,

235
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:08,040
and i've been doing it
since...

236
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,041
you know, school.

237
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,544
People ask me,
"were you a..."

238
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:15,548
you know, "you must have been
the class clown."

239
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:19,552
And i say, uh,
"no, i wasrt."

240
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,554
But i sat beside
the class clown,

241
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,056
and I... i studied him,

242
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,560
and, uh, and saw
how he made people laugh.

243
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,563
And so i picked some things up,
and, uh, you know,

244
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:32,565
and at parties
and family functions,

245
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,569
i have to say, i love,
you know, breaking people up.

246
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,572
So, there's a thing
that i think i got...

247
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,575
a... a... an entertaining bug

248
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:46,078
from my grandfather, uh,
chaim progot

249
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,082
who was very, very big
in the yiddish theater

250
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,083
back in new york.

251
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:56,088
He was in the... the very...
the sardonically irreverent

252
00:09:56,088 --> 00:10:00,092
I said more ham.

253
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:03,095
And that revue,
i believe, was 1914,

254
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:06,599
and that revue
is what made him famous.

255
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:10,603
Incidentally, the song
bubbee made a kishke

256
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,104
came from that revue.

257
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,607
My... my father, bless him,

258
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,609
brought me
into... into the business.

259
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:20,112
This was his dental practice,
uh, before,

260
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:22,114
and i joke with my wife
that, uh, you know,

261
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,617
at that point,
that's when the, uh,

262
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:28,120
the money
started rolling in.

263
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,623
You know.

264
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:34,126
Brave making m-more wampum

265
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:36,128
to buy pelts.

266
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,134
One happy squaw in wigwam.

267
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,136
Happy as mongoose.

268
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,640
That, uh...

269
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,643
is, of course,
from johnny carson who, uh...

270
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:53,145
one of my heroes
in a very funny bit.

271
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:57,817
When i see lips
waiting to be kissed

272
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,318
I can't stop

273
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:00,820
I can't stop

274
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,323
For that lightning,
oh, it's striking

275
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,325
Again

276
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:07,827
Yeah

277
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,831
Lightning's striking

278
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,834
Again and
again and again and

279
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:22,842
I'm going to do a scene
from the movieraging bull.

280
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,846
You fucked my wife?

281
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,848
What?

282
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,349
You fucked my wife?

283
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,852
How can you ask me
a question like that?

284
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,353
How can you ask me?

285
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:35,855
I'm your brother
and you ask me that?

286
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,857
Where do you get the balls
big enough to ask me that?

287
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:41,360
Basically for
the last 15 years,

288
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,863
i have been
the music teacher

289
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:46,365
at blaine high,

290
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,868
um, and part of my job,

291
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,870
and a very
important part

292
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,872
is to put on a show
every year,

293
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,874
which i have done
completely by myself.

294
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:57,877
This year it's going
to be different

295
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:01,380
because corky,
being from new york,

296
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,882
being a professional

297
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:08,387
and having put on some very
theatrical productions here,

298
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:13,893
uh, is going to be
directing the show this year

299
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:16,896
and i'm going to be
the musical director,

300
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:18,397
which is different for me.

301
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,903
Teacher's pet

302
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:28,407
I wanna be teacher's pet

303
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,911
I want to be
huddled and cuddled

304
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,914
And close to you
as i can get

305
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,919
Teacher's pride

306
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,923
I wanna be teacher's pride

307
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,432
Dr. Pearl! How are you?
Ron albertson.

308
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:54,934
Yes, ron.

309
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:56,435
My wife sheila.

310
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:58,437
You remember her
from previous bills.

311
00:12:58,437 --> 00:12:59,939
Hello, sheila.

312
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:00,940
What are you
doing here?

313
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,943
I'm here, you know,
trying out for the big show.

314
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:04,944
Congratulations.

315
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,445
No, why are you
here really?

316
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:10,449
I'm... i told my wife
i'd come out for this show.

317
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,451
You know, i thought
i'd give it a shot.

318
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:13,953
Give it your best shot,

319
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,454
which won't be the first
shot you ever gave.

320
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:17,456
Hope it doesn't leave corky
numb like most of them.

321
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,959
It's like pulling teeth
to get a discount from him.

322
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,461
Why don't you give some
caramels to the little girl?

323
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:23,963
Future customers and all.

324
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,464
So

325
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:28,467
I can be teacher's pet

326
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,470
Long after
school is through

327
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:34,473
Teacher, teacher,
i love you

328
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,475
Whoa!

329
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:42,481
High

330
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,983
Ahem. Maybe just...

331
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:46,485
ahhh. Mmm.

332
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:50,489
I dream of jeanie

333
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:54,994
With
the light brown hair

334
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:59,498
Floating like a vapor

335
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:04,003
On the soft summer air

336
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,004
Look out!

337
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,006
Camptown races
sing this song

338
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:09,008
Doo-dah, doo-dah

339
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,010
Camptown racetrack
5 miles long

340
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,012
Oh, doo-dah day

341
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,513
Gwine to run all night

342
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:17,016
Gwine to run all day

343
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,018
Bet my money
on the bob-tail nag

344
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,519
?
Somebody bet on the bay?

345
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,023
Bay, bay, bay

346
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:29,028
Way down
upon the swannee ribber

347
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:39,538
Floating like

348
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:42,041
A vapor

349
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,545
On the soft summer

350
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:54,053
Air

351
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:58,057
Air

352
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:01,560
That was...
very nice.

353
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,561
Very good.
Very good.

354
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,063
Well, thank you,
dr. Pearl.

355
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,065
Well, thank you very much.

356
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:07,566
We'll let you know.

357
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,568
Very good.

358
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,070
Thank you.

359
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,572
Thank you.

360
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:16,075
He can
actually sing.

361
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,077
He's good.
wow.

362
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:20,079
The albertsons?

363
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,091
Ding-dong.

364
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,592
Oh!

365
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,095
I wonder who knows i'm
vacationing here at the oasis.

366
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,598
Am i late?

367
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:40,599
You!

368
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,600
Surprised?

369
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,102
How did you find me?

370
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:45,104
I have my ways.

371
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,606
Would you like to
come in for coffee?

372
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:51,110
You don't need to answer

373
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,113
There's no need
to speak

374
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,619
I'll be
your belly dancer

375
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,621
Prancer

376
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:05,124
And i will be
your sheik

377
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:09,128
I don't need
a harem, honey

378
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:11,631
When you're
by my side

379
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:16,135
And you won't
need a camel

380
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:18,137
No, no

381
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:20,640
When i take
you for a ride

382
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,643
We'll need some coffee to go
with that ride, won't we?

383
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:26,646
You're always
full of surprises.

384
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:28,147
But, say, i wonder,

385
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,148
do we have time
for that coffee?

386
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:30,650
What time is it?

387
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,151
What time is it? Havert
you been paying attention?

388
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,152
It's

389
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:38,658
Midnight at the oasis

390
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:41,160
Thank you.
Oh... good.

391
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,162
That was great.

392
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:44,163
Really good.

393
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,165
Thanks a lot.

394
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,667
Thanks for coming.

395
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,669
Should we leave the...?

396
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,671
Why don't you
put that back there?

397
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,172
Yeah.
Strike it?

398
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,174
We've done a few shows
for corky before,

399
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:56,175
so we know all
the terms going in.

400
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:57,176
Thank you.

401
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,678
Thanks so much.
It was really fun.

402
00:16:58,678 --> 00:16:59,679
Thank you.

403
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,681
Thank you.

404
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,182
Wow.

405
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm feeling good

406
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,062
about where we stand now
with our cast.

407
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:14,068
I think that the elements,
as dr. Watson said to sherlock,

408
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,070
"are coming together, sir."

409
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,073
I'm very excited
about ron and sheila,

410
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,575
the old standbys,
the work horses.

411
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,577
I call them
the lunts of blaine.

412
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,580
Allan pearl. Interesting.
How do these...

413
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,082
where do they come from?

414
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,084
Sure, i'd seen him around.

415
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,086
It would never have occurred
to me to walk up

416
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:36,090
to the dentist and say,
"are you interested in this?"

417
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,094
But i was shopping
for my wife bonnie...

418
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:43,097
i buy most of her clothes...

419
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:47,601
and mrs. Pearl
was in the same shop.

420
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,104
And it just was an accident.

421
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:53,607
We started talking
about pantyhose.

422
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,111
She was saying... that's not
the point of the story,

423
00:17:57,111 --> 00:18:00,114
but what the point is
was that through

424
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,616
this accidental meeting,
it's like, you know,

425
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,118
it's like
a hitchcock movie

426
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:06,120
where you're thrown
into a rubber bag

427
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,124
and put in
the trunk of a car.

428
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,128
You find people.
You find them.

429
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:17,131
Something. Is it karma?

430
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:19,133
Maybe.

431
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:22,136
But we found him,
that's the important thing.

432
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:25,139
And i got bonnie
a wonderful pants suit.

433
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,142
They took me off
into a separate room.

434
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,644
I seen 'em taking
different people off.

435
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,146
Different ones of us off
in separate rooms.

436
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,149
They put me on
a big white table

437
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:37,652
and, uh, the guy
that take me there,

438
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:41,656
the one of them that took me
in there to examine me,

439
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,157
he probed me.

440
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:46,160
I was in there i bet
more than 3 or 4 hours,

441
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,162
in that room being probed.

442
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:50,164
And at one time or another,

443
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:52,667
there's different
ones of them come in,

444
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,668
4, 5, 6 of them
at different times,

445
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,670
and all of them probed me.

446
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,173
Not all at once, you know.
Individually.

447
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:03,177
Later on, years later,
now even still,

448
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,179
it's a funny thing.

449
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,181
It happened on a sunday,

450
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:08,683
and every sunday
about the time

451
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,186
that i was taken
onboard that ship,

452
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:15,690
i find i have
no feelings in my buttocks.

453
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,192
Casting a show is really

454
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,195
only the beginning
of the process.

455
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:24,198
There's also
the whole design concept,

456
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,701
what fabrics will work
for the costumes,

457
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,202
the lighting,

458
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:31,706
and it really becomes
a wrasslir match, i guess,

459
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:34,709
between me
and the muse of theater,

460
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,211
and most of all, dance.

461
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,023
I'd like you
to close your eyes now,

462
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,025
and i'd like you to try
something, all right?

463
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,027
Now, what are you thinking,

464
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:04,030
what are you feeling right now
with your eyes closed?

465
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,034
I feel a bree... you're
blowing in my ear.

466
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,536
All right, but, see,
you jumped to a conclusion.

467
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:11,537
Oh.

468
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:13,539
See, what i'm asking for is

469
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:16,042
your first feeling was not
that i was blowing on you,

470
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,544
it was more like...

471
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:23,549
virgin isles or
bahamanian or arubian.

472
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,550
Yes.

473
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,552
Yeah, he's at his rehearsal.

474
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:28,054
He's at his first rehearsal.

475
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,555
I don't know
what they're doing

476
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:31,557
'cause i never been
to one before,

477
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:35,061
but i bet they're introducing
themselves to each other.

478
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:37,063
You know, it's gonna be nice

479
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:39,065
to meet
some of these new folks,

480
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:43,569
'cause we don't socialize
with the creative types.

481
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,072
We got our scrabble club
and stuff,

482
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,574
and, um, you know,

483
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:51,077
and other people
with babies.

484
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:57,583
Right. Good.

485
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,586
Oh, the exercises
all mean something.

486
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:03,089
Even if you don't know what.

487
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:07,593
Dr. Pearl,
well, he'll come around,

488
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:13,099
and he'll learn like ron and
sheila and i have learned

489
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,600
that corky has a vision.

490
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,606
Whoa! Whoa!

491
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:24,610
Whoo!

492
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:27,613
Oh!

493
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,615
You!
Forget about it! Ha ha!

494
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:32,118
Ha ha! I went like this.

495
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:34,620
Forget about it. Ha ha!

496
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,122
With her it's ok,

497
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:39,625
but with him,
he thought... ha ha!

498
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:46,132
I, uh, i'm walking
on air, you know.

499
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,135
This is a sensation
which is... forget it.

500
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,637
When i became a dentist,
i thought i was happy,

501
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:54,640
but this is... this is
making me nervous now,

502
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,643
because i could have
wasted a lot of years.

503
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,146
I must say
i was very shocked to see

504
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:02,148
that dr. Pearl had
actually been cast.

505
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,649
Then i thought...

506
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,152
we're in a glamor profession,
being travel agents,

507
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:08,654
and he isn't in
such a glamorous...

508
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,656
one project,
we have to loosen him up.

509
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,658
I have a feeling
he's a little tight.

510
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,660
Particularly when
he's around us probably.

511
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,661
I don't think
he'll mind jokes.

512
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:16,662
You're intimidating,
ron...

513
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:17,663
i can't help it.

514
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,665
Because you have
so much experience.

515
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:21,667
Ron is going to help
everyone act,

516
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,170
'cause i know
ron gives me...

517
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,671
well, in all the productions
we've been in,

518
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,673
and when we do scene studies
at home together,

519
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,676
ron will have extensive,

520
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:33,679
you know, hour, 2-hour
sessions of notes for me,

521
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,680
and it's so helpful.

522
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:36,182
It's notes
for both of us.

523
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,683
No, but lately...

524
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:38,684
you get most of them.

525
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:40,686
He's trying to help me
to change my instincts

526
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,063
or at least ignore them.

527
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:46,567
Listen,
let me tell you why i'm here.

528
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,570
We're doing a show.
I won't beat around the bush.

529
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,571
We're doing a show
that i've written

530
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:53,574
about the 150th anniversary
of blaine,

531
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,076
and i know
you're an old blainian.

532
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,577
Yes?

533
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,580
And you're really right
for one of the parts.

534
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,583
It's the narrator
in the show.

535
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,085
One of the actor parts?

536
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,086
Yeah.

537
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:06,087
Oh, i don't know.

538
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:08,589
I've heard... i think
you're being modest

539
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:10,591
because i've heard
you've had some history

540
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:11,592
in show business.

541
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:15,596
Well, you know i did have,
i had a hankering

542
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:18,099
to be an actor
when i was a young fella,

543
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,600
when i got out of
the coast guard,

544
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:22,603
but i went to taxidermy
school instead.

545
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,105
Well, i took
a correspondence course.

546
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:25,106
Uh-huh.

547
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,108
I'll tell you something,
mr. Wooley,

548
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:31,112
what i'm looking for
in my shows are actors

549
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:33,614
and people that are
willing to work hard.

550
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:37,618
Well, yeah, i'm a hard worker
as you can see.

551
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:40,121
I love all the work
you've done.

552
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:44,625
That's a little gun rack
made out of deer hooves.

553
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,626
Oh, yeah.

554
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,129
Boy, i didn't know
deers could do that.

555
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,136
I know this
comes out of left field,

556
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,637
but i'm looking
for another actor.

557
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,640
And i was wondering
if you had any interest

558
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,143
in participating
in the show.

559
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:03,644
Does that appeal to you
in any way?

560
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:06,147
I'm not much of an actor,
i'm sorry.

561
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,150
I've never done that,
anything like that before.

562
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,152
Uh-huh.
Ok, fair enough,

563
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,654
but it might be
interesting, you know,

564
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,157
after, uh...
do you get off tonight?

565
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:17,658
What time do you
get off tonight?

566
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,660
Well, i get off at 8:00.

567
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,162
At 8:00 tonight?
Yeah.

568
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,664
Really? That's...
that's a long day.

569
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:24,665
Yeah.

570
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,667
Hey, dad,
this is, uh, mr...

571
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,169
st. Clair.
St. Clair.

572
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,170
He's a drama guy.

573
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,672
Yeah, and, um, at 8:00
you're off, though?

574
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,174
Right.
Yeah.

575
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:35,676
I have to tell you i'm not
much of an actor or singer.

576
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,178
Well, you know what?

577
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,679
That's what
charles laughton said.

578
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,681
You know?
And look what happened.

579
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:44,185
Did you change the fan belt
on that blue chevy?

580
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,187
No, i haven't
done that yet.

581
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,190
When you get done here,
will you get on that?

582
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,191
Yeah.

583
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,194
Um, so,
how tall are you?

584
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:54,195
6'2".

585
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:55,696
Really?
Mm-hmm.

586
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:56,697
Wow.

587
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,161
It's all the same

588
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:04,664
When we say, "nothing
ever happens in blaine,"

589
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:09,669
could we try you two
singing "blaine,"

590
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,672
where we really hear
the "ne" at the end.

591
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:16,175
And you guys just go,
"nothing ever happens in blai."

592
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:18,177
Don't say the "ne."
They say the nes.

593
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,679
And the same thing...
"nothing ever happens,

594
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,681
it's all the same."

595
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:23,683
And you sing,
"it's all the sa."

596
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,184
Let's try it once,
ok, jean?

597
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:27,186
1, 2, 3, and...

598
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,689
i know it's hard
to jump into this,

599
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,691
because it must seem
like a, you know...

600
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:33,192
a new world,

601
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:35,194
but we're gonna
ease you into it.

602
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,696
And if you ever
have any questions,

603
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:39,699
you can always call me up.
I'll give you my...

604
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:40,700
i have a private number.

605
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,702
It's not listed,
so don't lose it.

606
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:45,204
And do not give it out
to... to anyone.

607
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:49,208
"How high a ridge,
i could not tell,

608
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,211
for the sun,
the sun has..."

609
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,713
not pinching your shirt.

610
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:55,715
I want, you see...
hook in those thumbs.

611
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,216
Thumbs?

612
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:59,719
Yeah, there you go.

613
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:02,221
Yeah.
Just... that's right.

614
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:04,724
"How high a ridge,
i could not tell..."

615
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:06,726
see what's happening
with your voice already?

616
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,729
'Cause it's almost as if you're
squeezing your boobies out,

617
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,231
and it's... it's going to be
going out into that audience.

618
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:13,733
Pushing it
right out there.

619
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:15,234
I could try a "how."

620
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:19,739
"How... how high a ridge,
i could not tell..."

621
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:30,750
Keep in time.

622
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,752
Ok.

623
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,253
Right.

624
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:35,254
Robin in the nest.

625
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:37,256
Ok.

626
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:38,758
Right.

627
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,259
Good.

628
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,761
This'll dominate the show.

629
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:46,766
By the pool

630
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:49,268
In the school
by the fires of yule

631
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:51,270
It's the rule

632
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,773
There's a stool,
there's a stool

633
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,274
Stools are where

634
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:58,277
Once upon a time
you'd find a chair

635
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:00,279
A chair's for fools

636
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,782
Everybody wants stools

637
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,784
Stool boom

638
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:07,787
From the parlor
to the pool room

639
00:27:07,787 --> 00:27:10,790
?
Everyone knows our name?

640
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,291
Whose script
is that?

641
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,793
Stool...
Oh, sorry.

642
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,294
No, drool.

643
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:16,796
You will...
Oh, they're gonna be...

644
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:17,797
Never stopping

645
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,298
Never breathing,
working

646
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:25,805
I don't want to interfere,

647
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,808
but i think it would be...

648
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,812
i think we have
to work on...

649
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:33,813
i can't hear you.

650
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:37,316
I think we have to work on
the music a little bit more.

651
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,317
Fine.

652
00:27:38,317 --> 00:27:40,820
But i don't want
to make trouble, so...

653
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,822
and i don't
really want to do this

654
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:44,824
in front of them,
but i think...

655
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,826
where do you
want to do it?

656
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,830
Well, i think we have to
sit down and make a schedule

657
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,833
that includes
some... some music time,

658
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:57,336
'cause i think jean and i
have to work...

659
00:27:57,837 --> 00:27:59,338
why are you whispering?

660
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm right here,
you know? I don't...

661
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:02,842
oh, i'm sorry.

662
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:05,845
Do you want me
to talk louder?

663
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:08,848
Because i think
that it would be...

664
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:10,349
well,
now it's too loud.

665
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:13,352
You know, just talk like
a normal person, ok?

666
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:16,355
I think what they
were doing was good.

667
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,857
To me, you rehearse,
you rehearse.

668
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,359
You get it perfect. You know
exactly what you're doing.

669
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,360
And then what?

670
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:22,862
And then you
forget about it.

671
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:23,863
Let me pinpoint you.

672
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,364
You said they learn it,
they forget it,

673
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:26,866
and that's ok?

674
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,367
That's f... great.

675
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,368
Well,
they've forgotten it...

676
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:31,871
but they never learned it.
So when did they learn it?

677
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:33,372
I'm just saying,
when do we have the time...

678
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:34,373
but what i'm saying is,

679
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:35,875
if they're gonna
forget it anyway,

680
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,376
then what difference
does it make?

681
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:40,379
You see what i mean?
It's like one of those...

682
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:42,381
it's like a...
it's a zen thing.

683
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:44,884
It's like, you know...
you know,

684
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,886
how many babies,
you know, fit

685
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,387
in... in the tire thing?

686
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,389
That whole...
the old joke, you know?

687
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,392
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, you have a point.

688
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,394
Uh, it's, you know,
an interesting point.

689
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,773
And how'd you
find this place?

690
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,275
Well,
we've... we've been, uh...

691
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,777
coming here for many,
many years.

692
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:04,278
Oh, yeah,
we come every thursday.

693
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,281
Well, with the rehearsals,
you won't be able to now.

694
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:08,282
This is true.

695
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:09,283
You know, in china,

696
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:10,785
they'll kill a monkey
at the table

697
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:11,786
and split its head open,

698
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:13,788
eat the brains
right out of it.

699
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,291
We had friends...
ew.

700
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,293
Barbara and bruce,
remember?

701
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,795
Who went to, uh, china,
and i'm sure...

702
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,296
you're in
the travel business...

703
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:23,297
that you've been there,

704
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:25,800
but they went to peking,
where they make the ducks,

705
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,803
and what they say is
that the food over there

706
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,304
is not as good...

707
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:33,307
you can't get a sauce as
thick and sweet over there.

708
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,308
They don't make it
like that.

709
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,310
Their food is like
steamed or something.

710
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,812
And they should've
called you, because...

711
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:39,814
yeah, we got
some good packages.

712
00:29:39,814 --> 00:29:40,815
Incidentally, if you two

713
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,316
ever want to get down
to miami, miami beach,

714
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,819
we got a great package.
A week, 2 weeks.

715
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:45,820
All expense... yeah.

716
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,822
You get everything
you need,

717
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:50,324
any kind of food
in blaine. You don't...

718
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:51,826
you know,
you get chinese here.

719
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:53,828
Uh, no need to go...

720
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,329
we're talking about
miami now, dear.

721
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,331
Yeah, we'd love to go.
We'd love to...

722
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:58,332
is it a direct?

723
00:29:58,332 --> 00:29:59,333
A week, 2 weeks.

724
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,835
Like there aren't
chinese people in miami.

725
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,837
Well, we should.
You know, we've stopped...

726
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:03,838
what does that have to do...

727
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,339
of course there are
chinese people in miami.

728
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,340
We're talking
about china now.

729
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:07,842
I'm talking about
going to miami.

730
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,343
Miami. We're talking
about miami now.

731
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,345
Dear, why don't you put
some food on your stomach

732
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,346
before you have
any more wine?

733
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,348
What's it...
what's it...

734
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,851
shh. Girl talk.

735
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,854
What's it like to be
with a circumcised man?

736
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:21,856
That is interesting.

737
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:24,859
I'd ask you more about
that, but ron said...

738
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,360
"that whole
jew thing's..."

739
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,362
aah.

740
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:30,364
'Cause when ron
had his surgery...

741
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,365
all right, all right,
all right.

742
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,867
When ron had
his surgery, i said,

743
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,368
"hey, circumcise it
while you're at it."

744
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,871
'Cause i had never been
with anyone else.

745
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:38,873
Rors the only man
i've been with.

746
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,375
Well, what surgery, uh...
did he have some major...

747
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,377
nothing. I had a little
minor corrective surgery.

748
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:44,879
Could we have some coffee
at this table, please?

749
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,881
It's not minor anymore.

750
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,383
Just...

751
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:52,386
well, maybe, you know,
we should change the subject.

752
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:55,890
I had what, you know,
most guys would, uh...

753
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,391
dream of, you know.

754
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,895
And i had to have, uh,
penis-reduction surgery.

755
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:01,896
I'm sorry?

756
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:02,897
Penis reduction.

757
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,398
Which there aren't many.

758
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,399
You're gonna say,
"i never heard of that,"

759
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,901
'cause there haven't
been many cases.

760
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,903
I said,
"ron, do something."

761
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:11,906
And he said, "why don't
you get one of those...

762
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:12,907
vagina enlargements?"

763
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:14,909
Oh, dear! Could we have
some coffee over here?

764
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:16,911
Have you tried
the egg rolls?

765
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:18,412
Unbelievable.

766
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:19,914
Let me ask you something.
You're a medical man.

767
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:20,915
Yes.

768
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:22,917
I want to ask you
something. If you... you...

769
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:25,920
oh! Ohh,
for heavers sake! No!

770
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,421
No. No, please.
No! I just want...

771
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:28,923
doctor, please...

772
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:32,426
medicine man not go near
dances with stumpy. No.

773
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,220
Everybody, everybody,

774
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,223
i have a little
announcement to make.

775
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,224
I wasrt gonna tell you.

776
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:40,226
I sent out 10 letters

777
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:42,728
to different producers
in new york city.

778
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,729
That's great.

779
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:46,732
This is from
the oppeneimer organization.

780
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:49,235
"Dear mr. St. Clair,

781
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,237
"in response to your letter

782
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:54,240
"re: Blaine, missouri's
150th anniversary

783
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,743
"and the debut
of your original musical

784
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,745
"red, white, & blaine,

785
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,747
"the oppeneimer
organization

786
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,250
"is delighted to inform you

787
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,252
"that it will be sending
a representative,

788
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:08,254
"mr. Mort guffman,

789
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:10,256
"to view the production

790
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:12,258
and enlighten us
with his comments."

791
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:13,759
How about that?

792
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,761
"We thank you
for the invitation."

793
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:20,766
And it says, "best regards,
samuel oppeneimer jr."

794
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:24,270
Wow. What does
this mean, corky?

795
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,272
What it means is,

796
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:29,275
we may be goir
to broadway.

797
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:30,276
Aah!

798
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,778
Ohh!

799
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,781
Oh, this is
great news!

800
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:37,283
How about that?

801
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,284
Did you hear that?

802
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:41,287
My aunt...
i brought out her atlas

803
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:42,788
that i look at a lot,

804
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,791
this big blue book,
and opened up to new york.

805
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:48,294
And it's an island,
is really what it is.

806
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:51,797
It's this...
island full of people

807
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:55,801
of different colors
and different ideas,

808
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,804
and i can't... it sounds
like a lot of fun to me.

809
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:03,309
You know, we don't see
much of that in blaine.

810
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,313
I'd like to maybe
meet some guys and...

811
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:09,815
italian guys or...

812
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:11,317
you know,
i've watched tv and stuff.

813
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:14,320
L-i'm gonna be glad to do
the show on broadway,

814
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,821
and there'll probably
be other offers.

815
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,823
Mmm. Keeping
our fingers crossed.

816
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:20,826
But i don't know if the theater
and the stage is for me.

817
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,328
For one thing,

818
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:24,330
there's an awful lot
of memorizing of lines,

819
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,832
and i think... and i think...
you know what i'm thinking.

820
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,834
Yeah. That's always
been in your way.

821
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,836
The ultimate goal...
hollywood.

822
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:33,339
Even when i was a kid
doing my impressions...

823
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:34,840
"Here's looking at you, babe."

824
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:36,342
And, uh...

825
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,344
"You don't care

826
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:41,847
about anyone but yourself."

827
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,349
Who was that?
Henry fonda.

828
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:44,850
I always have to tell her
who i'm doing.

829
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,353
She always laughs,
"now, who is that?"

830
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:48,354
But i think, back there,

831
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:49,355
there's always
the germ in my mind

832
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,857
that that's where i'd end up...
on the silver screen.

833
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:54,360
And you got the face
for it, too, darlir.

834
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,861
You know, i want to try

835
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:57,363
that "less is more"
kind of acting,

836
00:33:57,363 --> 00:33:59,365
where you just... when you're
talking to someone,

837
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:01,867
you close your eyes,
and then you look at them

838
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,369
when you're not
talking to the person.

839
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,371
I mean, you open your eyes
when you're looking away,

840
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:06,872
but then when you
talk to the person,

841
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,374
you go like that.
And you open your eyes,

842
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:09,375
and then you look back
at the person,

843
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,377
but you never open your eyes
when you're talking to them.

844
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:12,878
The guffman news
is really big,

845
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,382
and, uh, i don't
truthfully think

846
00:34:16,382 --> 00:34:19,385
that the cast understand
how big.

847
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,387
Um, they don't know
the new york thing.

848
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:23,389
They haven't been
through it, and i have.

849
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,891
You know, so it is kind of
on my shoulders,

850
00:34:26,392 --> 00:34:30,896
and... going to the big apple
for the first time,

851
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:31,897
you know, is...

852
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,400
such an experience.
You never forget it.

853
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,402
It stays with you
for your whole life.

854
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,404
Me, you know,
right out of the navy,

855
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,906
you know,
fresh off a destroyer,

856
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,909
uh, with a dance belt and a tube
of chapstick, basically.

857
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,412
You know, not really much
to call my own.

858
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:49,415
And then basically
being slammed down

859
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,917
for 10 or so years,
you know,

860
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,420
off off off off broadway,

861
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,423
and then enough is enough,
ok? I get the joke.

862
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,426
And... is that gonna happen
again? I don't know.

863
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:01,927
I mean, and i don't want it
to happen again.

864
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,430
In my deepest,
deepest of hearts,

865
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,432
i do not want it
to happen again.

866
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:09,935
Mr. Guffman brings with him...
a reputation,

867
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:13,439
something bigger than anyone
in this town has ever known,

868
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:16,942
and if i am to get back
to new york city

869
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,444
on my terms,

870
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:21,447
i cannot deliver him...
a stinky product.

871
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:25,952
I really have to be
presenting him a package.

872
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:30,957
A beautifully wrapped,
glossy, sweet-smelling show.

873
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:34,460
What i need from you...

874
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,463
because you're the bosses
of the town, essentially,

875
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:38,464
and i know that...

876
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:39,966
is...

877
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,468
this is so hard.

878
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:44,470
I mean, there's nothing
easy about this.

879
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,473
This is like when you're
getting your legs waxed,

880
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:49,475
and they whip that thing off
real fast.

881
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,978
That's what this is like.

882
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:55,481
I need more money.

883
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:57,483
How much do you need?

884
00:35:57,483 --> 00:36:00,486
Steve's right. How much
are you thinking of, now?

885
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:02,488
Ok.

886
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:04,490
What i need...

887
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:07,994
is 100,000.

888
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,502
Oh, brother!

889
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:17,503
Corky!

890
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:18,504
He is good.

891
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:19,505
He is.

892
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,007
And let me explain,

893
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:23,009
let me explain
what...

894
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,010
go ahead.

895
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,512
Oh, man, my heart stopped
for a second there.

896
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,514
He started going "money"
and the whole guffman thing.

897
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:31,017
Let me just explain
really what that entails.

898
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:34,020
I bought it all the way,
by the way.

899
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,022
He's not joking.
He's serious, glenn.

900
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:37,523
He's... he's not kidding?

901
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:39,525
Corky,
our entire budget

902
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:42,528
for the entire year
is $15,000 for everything,

903
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:45,031
and that includes
swimming.

904
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,033
Well, i don't have any
swimming in my show.

905
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,035
No, no. I mean the pool.
We have to keep up the pool.

906
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:51,537
That's everything.
The entire year is 15,000.

907
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,039
100,000?!

908
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,042
Look, you're a nice fella
and all, glad you're here,

909
00:36:56,042 --> 00:37:00,046
but if i may be blunt...
what's wrong with you?

910
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,047
I mean...

911
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:05,051
So what i'm
understanding here,

912
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:06,552
correct me if i'm wrong,

913
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:10,056
is that you're not
giving me any money.

914
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:12,058
So now i'm left
basically with nothing.

915
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:15,061
I'm left with zero,

916
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,063
in which... in which...
what can i do with zero?

917
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:20,066
You know, what can I...
i can't do anything with it.

918
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,068
This is my life here
we're talking about.

919
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:23,569
We're not just talking about,
you know, something else.

920
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,571
We're talking about
my life, you know?

921
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:28,074
And it's forcing me to do
something i don't want to do...

922
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,575
to leave,

923
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:32,578
to... to go out
and just leave and go home

924
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:35,081
and say...
make a clean cut here

925
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,083
and say, "no, way, corky.

926
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,085
You're not putting up
with these people."

927
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,587
And i'll tell you why
i can't put up with you people.

928
00:37:41,587 --> 00:37:43,589
Because
you're bastard people.

929
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:46,092
That's what you are.
You're just bastard people,

930
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,093
and i'm going home,
and i'm gonna...

931
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:51,097
i'm gonna bite my pillow
is what i'm gonna do!

932
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,646
What do you
use on your skin?

933
00:37:59,146 --> 00:37:59,647
Vaseline.

934
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,149
Petroleum jelly
on your skin? Yeah.

935
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,651
You are getting away
with murder, libby.

936
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,153
You're young and it's ok,
but have i told you...

937
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:07,655
libby, i have
an announcement.

938
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,657
I have to talk to you.

939
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,659
Excuse me, libby.
I have to talk to you.

940
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,160
I'm gonna round us up.

941
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,662
Hold on. Gee.

942
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:15,663
Dr. Pearl.

943
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:16,664
Morning.

944
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:18,666
Good morning.
We have an announcement.

945
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,168
We have to talk. Ok?

946
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:24,171
Gather around, please.
Gather around.

947
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,673
Libby! Sheila.

948
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,174
Excuse me, ron.

949
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,176
Thank you. Dr. Pearl.

950
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,178
Please be quiet.
I have an announcement.

951
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,179
We've got to listen up here.

952
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,681
Excuse me, are we
gonna be vocalizing?

953
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,182
We will be vocalizing.

954
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,684
Before we start, i'd
like to clear my throat.

955
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:41,689
Yes, we'll be doing...
we'll be vocalizing.

956
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,691
We'll be doing a lot of...
excuse me, please!

957
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:47,194
Everybody, let's be serious now
just for a moment,

958
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:49,196
and let's all listen up, ok?

959
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:52,700
Corky has left the show,
and i am taking over.

960
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,203
And what i want to do today
is start with some music,

961
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,706
do dancing,
and work on our lines.

962
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,708
And my hope is
at the end of 5 days,

963
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,209
we will know
what we're doing...

964
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,210
what do you mean?

965
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,211
And we will have a show.

966
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,212
Corky's left?

967
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:07,214
You mean he's left
for today or permanently?

968
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:10,718
Corky has quit the show,
and it's my show.

969
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:12,219
Corky!

970
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,721
Cork!

971
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:15,723
Corky!

972
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,227
Here, you go up.

973
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,729
Boy, i only
do that twice a day,

974
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,230
that's good exercise.

975
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,732
You know,
most athletic injuries...

976
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:25,733
is he not answering?

977
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,234
Corky,
we love you!

978
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,235
Corky, open up!

979
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,236
Corky!

980
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:31,238
Corky, we love you!
We want you to live!

981
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,240
There may be
something wrong.

982
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,241
Try the door.
Is the door unlocked?

983
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,254
He wants to be
alone right now.

984
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:49,256
I'd never forgive myself
if something was wrong.

985
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:52,760
Just shut up! Just shut up!
Jesus christ!

986
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,261
Freaks!

987
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,264
Freaky people, my god!

988
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,266
I know
how he feels, too!

989
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:03,270
Guess i can just go back
to the dairy queen, you know.

990
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,777
They said
they'd take me back.

991
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,783
I always have a place
at the dairy queen.

992
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:21,789
You got to stop crying.

993
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:23,291
She hasn't cried
this much

994
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:26,294
since the day we got
married. Honestly.

995
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:28,796
You know,
this is wonderful.

996
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,299
Why didn't i react like this
when i was playing football

997
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:33,801
for the blaine panthers
and our quarterback

998
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:35,303
went down with
a dislocated knee?

999
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:36,804
I should have said,
"time-out!"

1000
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:37,805
'Cause you're strong, ron,
you're strong.

1001
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:39,307
You're just a big brick!

1002
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,309
Let's delay the game,
and my lip would tremble,

1003
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,311
and i see we have
an injured quarterback.

1004
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:45,313
Let's give up. No.
You know what we did?

1005
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:47,315
We brought in the
second-string quarterback.

1006
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:48,316
When he went down,

1007
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:49,817
we brought in the
third-string quarterback,

1008
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,319
and we went out,
and we whipped the pants

1009
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:52,820
off of harry truman
high school,

1010
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,822
and next week, went out
and mopped the floor

1011
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,824
with blessed, uh,
heart of mary.

1012
00:40:56,824 --> 00:40:59,827
And they went on to win
the state championship.

1013
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:05,833
To tell you
the truth,

1014
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:08,336
i haven't even
thought about it.

1015
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:11,339
Not for a... not for a second
have i even dwelled on the fact

1016
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,840
that the show's over.

1017
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,843
I don't, uh, i don't, uh,
think about it.

1018
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:17,345
L... i try not
to think about it,

1019
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:19,347
and therefore,
i, you know, don't,

1020
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,349
because it's
a very healthy way

1021
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,352
to deal with something
that is ultimately

1022
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:25,853
not that important
in the long run.

1023
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:29,357
It's not... not, uh,
not important at all,

1024
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,858
you know, for me.

1025
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:37,365
I'm just so sad for corky,
you know, i mean...

1026
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:39,367
i think these
creative people,

1027
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,869
they're real emotional,
and, um...

1028
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,372
i think the important thing
about show-biz people

1029
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,874
is that you got to have
a-another life.

1030
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:50,378
And I... i know, you know, uh,
he's... he's got a wife.

1031
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:51,879
I guess she's out of town.

1032
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:55,383
Um... because i haven't
seen her.

1033
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,884
I've never seen her,

1034
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:59,387
so, you know,
that could be the problem.

1035
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:01,889
You know, maybe she's
just not supportive.

1036
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,517
Corky, without you,
there's no show.

1037
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,018
Without the show,
there's no celebration.

1038
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:09,021
Without celebration,
there's no blaine.

1039
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,524
So you see how
it's a domino effect.

1040
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:13,526
You know how dominoes
do that.

1041
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,528
Without blaine,
i got news for you,

1042
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:16,529
there's no missouri.

1043
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,030
Blaine is the heart
of missouri.

1044
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,033
What happens if missouri
goes down? You tell me.

1045
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:25,037
We need the magic back
in the show, is what we need,

1046
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,540
and it ain't gonna
happen with lloyd.

1047
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,043
Lloyd is a music teacher,
and he shops at walmart.

1048
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:32,545
He doesn't even
support the town.

1049
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,548
The person who needs
you the most...

1050
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,049
is blaine fabin.

1051
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:38,551
Hear, hear.

1052
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:41,554
And i'm not just saying that
because i am a fabin.

1053
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:43,055
Ok, ok.

1054
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:45,057
I'm saying that
because i just know

1055
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:48,060
that nobody
can touch, um...

1056
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,563
that whole...

1057
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:52,565
thing.

1058
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:54,066
That whole thing, hmm?

1059
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:56,068
You could
take a nickel,

1060
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,070
and you could make it
into a million dollars,

1061
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,573
because this man is a genius,
and we cannot lose that.

1062
00:43:00,573 --> 00:43:02,575
Look what you did withbarefoot
when you came to this town.

1063
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:04,076
Did you have
any budget then?

1064
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:05,578
You didn't have
$100,000 then,

1065
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,079
and look what happened
to that show.

1066
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,581
And what aboutbackdraft?

1067
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,082
You took a little bit
of cellophane,

1068
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:11,584
and you made it
into flames!

1069
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,586
You can still
feel the heat.

1070
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,087
You know what?
You're not wrong.

1071
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:18,090
We need you
to take your magic wand...

1072
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,094
and wave it and make
this town special again,

1073
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:23,596
is what we need.

1074
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:26,599
Will you do it?

1075
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,100
Come on back, cork.

1076
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,101
Please.

1077
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:37,109
Whoo!
Whoo!

1078
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:38,110
Whoo!

1079
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,613
Whoo!

1080
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:41,614
Whoo!

1081
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:43,115
Whoo!

1082
00:43:43,115 --> 00:43:44,116
Yay!

1083
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,117
Thank you.

1084
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:46,118
Yay!

1085
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:48,120
Whoo!
Whoo!

1086
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,622
Please! Oh!

1087
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,123
Whoo!

1088
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:53,125
All right,
thank you, thank you.

1089
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,628
Thank you. Thank you.

1090
00:43:56,128 --> 00:44:00,132
Ok, let's pretend that
it never happened, ok?

1091
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,635
And let's just jump
intocovered wagons.

1092
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:05,137
All right? Let's start
from the dance part.

1093
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:06,138
Covered wagons!

1094
00:44:10,142 --> 00:44:12,144
Whoo!

1095
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:15,147
Waah!

1096
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:18,651
In a funny way,
what the city council did

1097
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:20,653
was really give me
a challenge,

1098
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:24,657
and it's a challenge
that i am going to accept.

1099
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:27,660
It's like in the olden days
and the days in france

1100
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,163
when men would slap each other
with their gloves,

1101
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:32,164
and say, you know,

1102
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:34,166
"d'artagnan, you know,

1103
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,669
how dare you talk
to me like that, you!"

1104
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,671
And smack 'im.

1105
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:40,840
Stool boom

1106
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,843
From the parlor
to the pool room

1107
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:47,346
We're the center
of a stool boom

1108
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:51,350
?
Everyone knows our name?

1109
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,852
Working, making

1110
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:54,854
Never stopping,
never sleeping

1111
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:56,355
Working, building

1112
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:57,857
Some for selling,
some for keeping

1113
00:44:58,357 --> 00:44:59,859
You will drool

1114
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:02,862
At the splendor
of these magic stools

1115
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:04,363
It's the rule

1116
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,866
Everyone has a stool

1117
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,367
Just 3 legs

1118
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:11,370
It's the thing
for which a monarch begs

1119
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,372
Hock your jewels

1120
00:45:13,372 --> 00:45:14,874
I did want to mention
one thing.

1121
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:16,375
Mm-hmm?

1122
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:19,378
Specs?

1123
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:22,381
1845, you know,

1124
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:25,384
i think it's
a little problem.

1125
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:26,886
Oh, oh, oh.

1126
00:45:27,386 --> 00:45:29,388
My glasses.

1127
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:30,890
You're saying...

1128
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,391
i don't think
you should wear them.

1129
00:45:32,391 --> 00:45:33,893
Don't wear them
in the show?

1130
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,394
It's mostly in
covered wagons,

1131
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:36,395
because i think
that's the one

1132
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:39,899
where it's just not
as believable.

1133
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:42,902
Of course, when you get
further up in time,

1134
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:44,904
historically, it's...

1135
00:45:44,904 --> 00:45:46,906
i can see
a couple of problems.

1136
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:48,908
Nothing major. Nothing
that we can't solve.

1137
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:51,410
One, um...

1138
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,412
contrary
to public opinion,

1139
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:57,416
i don't see very well
without my glasses,

1140
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,419
so i'm thinking is that
going to be a problem

1141
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:02,922
for me... just look out.

1142
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:07,927
And the other thing
which is also a problem

1143
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:11,430
is i have a very lazy eye

1144
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:17,436
which these prescription
glasses help correct.

1145
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:20,815
Wo
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and...

1146
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:25,319
Blue sky, blue sea

1147
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:29,323
Blue grass, blue tree

1148
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:31,325
Red as the fire
in our hearts

1149
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,828
That makes
this country strong

1150
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:35,830
Red as the fire
in our hearts

1151
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,832
That helps us
sing this song

1152
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:39,834
Getting off the horse
is not a problem.

1153
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:41,836
I can get off
the horse like that,

1154
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:42,837
but where
i'm having a problem

1155
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:44,338
is that sometimes
the horse comes out

1156
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:46,841
and i can't
get past the cow.

1157
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:48,843
So i have to kind of
do this when i come out.

1158
00:46:48,843 --> 00:46:51,345
"Gather round,
for i have news."

1159
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:53,347
I don't know which
is more lifelike,

1160
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:55,349
the horse
or dr. Pearl.

1161
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,852
Oh! Ha ha ha!
You.

1162
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:00,855
Corky?
Here's the phone.

1163
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:01,856
It's johnny.

1164
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:03,357
I feel
like a hero...

1165
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:05,860
hello?

1166
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,862
Yeah?

1167
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:10,865
What do you mean?

1168
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:12,867
Then we back up.

1169
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:14,869
But i've been waiting
for you to turn around...

1170
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,370
What are you saying?

1171
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:17,872
Shh!

1172
00:47:17,872 --> 00:47:20,374
I understand that.
No, i understand.

1173
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:21,876
Believe me,
i do understand.

1174
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:26,881
What can you do is
just say absolutely not!

1175
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,883
Do you understand that?

1176
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:30,384
I don't believe that.

1177
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,887
No, i'm sorry.
I do not accept that.

1178
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:34,388
That is not an answer, no.

1179
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:37,391
It's absolutely unacceptable
that you would say this now.

1180
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:40,394
Not today! No!

1181
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:44,398
And that's the way it is?

1182
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,400
Then i just hate you!

1183
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,403
And i hate your ass face!

1184
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:52,406
What's up?
Oh, corky.

1185
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:53,908
Johnny's not in the show.

1186
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:56,911
His dad said he has
to go back to work.

1187
00:47:56,911 --> 00:47:58,913
What does he think
this is, school,

1188
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,915
that he can be marked
absent one day?

1189
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,417
This is the day
of the show, y'all.

1190
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:04,418
Oh, my god.

1191
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:06,420
Just... just...

1192
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,922
This is
very strange.

1193
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:09,924
Ron, just... just let me think
for a second, all right?

1194
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:12,426
I've just got
to take a breath here

1195
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:15,429
and... and try to figure
this out, all right?

1196
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:23,437
It's tight.
That hurts.

1197
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:24,939
If you could hike
it up a little bit

1198
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:26,440
you'd get more room.

1199
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,942
I am pulling them up.

1200
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:29,944
Sort of trying to commit
to one side here, dear.

1201
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:33,447
This is johnny's costume,
and johnny is a lot...

1202
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:35,950
he's a different
body type than you are.

1203
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,452
This is... i don't...
i'm worried...

1204
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:39,954
i'm about
5 inches away...

1205
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:40,955
i understand.

1206
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:42,957
Wo Actors,
we're at 15 minutes.

1207
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:43,958
Oh, my god!
Aah!

1208
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,459
We're at 15.

1209
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,962
No, we gotta move now.
Come on.

1210
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:49,964
You're gonna have
to help me here.

1211
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,966
Ok, ok.
Help me here!

1212
00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:02,977
I'm so nervous.

1213
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:04,478
You're gonna be great.

1214
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:05,980
If there's an empty space,
just say a line.

1215
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,481
That's what i like to do.

1216
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,983
Even if it's
from another show.

1217
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,491
Agnes, where's
the lilac dress?

1218
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:18,492
You mean
the purple one?

1219
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:19,994
Yes. Where is it?

1220
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:21,495
Honey, i told you to lay off
the hot fudge sundaes.

1221
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:22,997
I couldn't let
the seams out.

1222
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:24,498
It's not here?

1223
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,500
Not it is not.
Hello, sweetheart.

1224
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,308
Oh, i destroyed
my makeup!

1225
00:49:42,308 --> 00:49:44,810
Mmm. Hark!
A rider approaches!

1226
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:45,811
Oh, god!

1227
00:49:45,811 --> 00:49:47,813
It's all right.
Just... careful.

1228
00:49:47,813 --> 00:49:49,815
I hope that
isn't too hot.

1229
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:51,817
No, no, it's just fine.

1230
00:50:32,858 --> 00:50:34,860
May i remind you, please?

1231
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,861
No glasses for
the first number.

1232
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:37,363
Oh, no, no, no, I...

1233
00:50:37,363 --> 00:50:39,865
actors?
We're at places.

1234
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:42,368
Have a good show everybody!
Break a leg!

1235
00:51:16,902 --> 00:51:19,405
Don't worry about anything
'cause it's gonna all roll...

1236
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:21,407
he's not here.

1237
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,908
He's not here.
What?

1238
00:51:22,908 --> 00:51:24,910
Not here? Guffman?

1239
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,911
Should we lower
the curtain?

1240
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:26,912
Corky!

1241
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:29,415
Everybody, look, look,

1242
00:51:29,415 --> 00:51:31,417
i've been through this
a million times.

1243
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,419
These new york types
like to come late.

1244
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,921
Believe me. I've never seen
one of them come on time

1245
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:37,923
in all my years
in the theater.

1246
00:51:38,424 --> 00:51:40,426
Take a deep breath...

1247
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:41,927
blow it out.

1248
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:44,430
He's gonna be here.
Let's just do a good show, ok?

1249
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,932
Everybody do a good show.
Hands in the middle.

1250
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:50,436
Wwwwwhoa!

1251
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:24,804
Oh, howdy.

1252
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:29,308
Eh, didn't see you
sneak up on me there.

1253
00:52:29,308 --> 00:52:30,810
But if you like,

1254
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,312
you're welcome to share
my campfire with me.

1255
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:36,816
I was just fixing
to get me some grub.

1256
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:39,318
Beans.
mmm.

1257
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:44,323
I love beans.
Big, fat, hot juicy beans.

1258
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:47,326
Now, don't get me
going on beans

1259
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:50,830
or i'll be jabberir away
till the sun comes up.

1260
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:54,333
But, you know,
now that i've got your ear,

1261
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:57,837
there is a story i wouldn't
mind sharing with you.

1262
00:52:57,837 --> 00:53:00,339
It's a tall tale
that grows taller

1263
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:02,341
with each passing year.

1264
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:05,845
It's the story of blaine.

1265
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,862
Well, we've traveled
long and far today.

1266
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:24,363
We must let the women
and children rest.

1267
00:53:24,363 --> 00:53:27,366
Don't you rest on our account,
daniel potter.

1268
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,870
We women are just as strong
and resilient as you men.

1269
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,371
Ha ha ha!

1270
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,373
I do believe you are,
rebecca.

1271
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:35,374
I do believe you are.

1272
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,878
California will be a sight
for these weary eyes.

1273
00:53:39,378 --> 00:53:41,881
Mine as well,
rebecca, mine as well.

1274
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:44,383
But right now we need
a campfire to warm our souls

1275
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:45,885
and to cook our food.

1276
00:53:45,885 --> 00:53:47,386
Done.

1277
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:50,890
Oh.

1278
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,391
Oh.

1279
00:53:52,391 --> 00:53:55,895
That will be quite enough
of that, billy whittaker.

1280
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:57,396
Just one kiss?

1281
00:53:57,396 --> 00:53:59,398
There'll be plenty
of time for kissing

1282
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:01,400
when we get
to california.

1283
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,402
lfwe get to california.

1284
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:05,404
Oh, we'll get there.

1285
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:08,407
Blaine fabin will
lead us there.

1286
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,409
Hark! A rider approaches.

1287
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:12,912
Blaine fabin
returns!

1288
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:16,415
Whoa!

1289
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,917
Ho there!

1290
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:21,921
Whoa, steady.

1291
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:24,924
Gather round
for i have news.

1292
00:54:25,424 --> 00:54:26,425
What news?

1293
00:54:26,926 --> 00:54:30,429
What did your keen and
perceptive eyes behold?

1294
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,432
Just up yonder,
there is a ridge.

1295
00:54:33,432 --> 00:54:35,935
How high a ridge,
i could not tell,

1296
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:38,938
for the sun had set
and darkness fell

1297
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:40,940
before i reached
its pinnacle.

1298
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,944
Then... a strange thing
happened.

1299
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:47,947
My nose started twitchir.

1300
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:51,450
There was a mysterious
scent in the night air.

1301
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,952
What? What kind
of scent?

1302
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:54,954
What was this
mysterious scent?

1303
00:54:55,454 --> 00:54:58,457
It was the scent
of salt water!

1304
00:54:58,457 --> 00:54:59,458
Oh!
Salt water!

1305
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,960
Salt water?

1306
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,130
Ladies and gentlemen,

1307
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,132
we have reached
our destination!

1308
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:08,634
We have
reached the pacific!

1309
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:11,637
Welcome to california!

1310
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:13,139
Yay!
Yay!

1311
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:20,646
Grab your feller
by the hand

1312
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:23,149
Welcome him
to the promised land

1313
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:25,651
Grab your lady
by the arm

1314
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:28,154
Take her out
behind the barn

1315
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:34,160
Everybody dance!

1316
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:45,671
Whoo!

1317
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,712
That was great!

1318
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:27,713
Shut up.
I can't believe...

1319
00:56:27,713 --> 00:56:28,714
oh, my!

1320
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:31,217
60 years went by,

1321
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:34,720
and the town of blaine kept
a-growir and a-changir.

1322
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,223
Every time you looked around,
a new house was going up,

1323
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:39,225
a new family was moving in.

1324
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:40,726
Hurry, agnes.

1325
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,728
I am trying to hurry.
There we go.

1326
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:44,730
You got my hat?
Where's my hat?

1327
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:47,233
Your hat? Right here
is your hat, darling.

1328
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:51,737
Mcgillicuddy's orchard became
the blaine elementary school.

1329
00:56:51,737 --> 00:56:54,740
They even laid track for
that newfangled invention,

1330
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,242
the iron horse,

1331
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,745
which brought a pretty
important visitor to blaine.

1332
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:04,250
Yay!
It's president mckinley!

1333
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,752
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1334
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:08,754
Good people of blaine,

1335
00:57:08,754 --> 00:57:11,257
they told me
my next stop was wichita,

1336
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:14,260
but i said,
"what about blaine?"

1337
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,762
Yay!
Hurrah!

1338
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:19,265
I guess i need
a new travel agent.

1339
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:25,271
Mr. President,
in honor of our visit...

1340
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:28,774
yourvisit toourtown,

1341
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:30,776
i present you humbly

1342
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,280
with this fair key
to our city.

1343
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,282
Well, i do declare,
i believe the key to this city

1344
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:38,784
is larger than
the city itself.

1345
00:57:40,786 --> 00:57:42,288
Wait, mr. President!

1346
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:43,789
What have we here?

1347
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:46,792
It's a footstool.
I make them.

1348
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,794
Well, isn't
that interesting?

1349
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,796
I'll take this back
to washington with me,

1350
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,798
and every time
i rest my feet

1351
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:55,801
i'll think of blaine.

1352
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:58,304
Yay!
Hurrah!

1353
00:57:58,304 --> 00:58:00,806
Hurrah!

1354
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:03,309
Now, we all know
that politicians

1355
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:05,311
aren't used to keeping
their word...

1356
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:07,313
he's here.
He's here.

1357
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,315
I told you
he was gonna come.

1358
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:10,816
Should we start
over again?

1359
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:13,319
He didn't see
covered wagons!

1360
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,029
Well, before you know it,

1361
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,031
everyone rich and poor alike

1362
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:20,034
had to have a blaine stool
in their home.

1363
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,536
The little town never
knew what hit it.

1364
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:27,541
Footstool factories
sprouted up like toadstools.

1365
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,543
Everyone had a good job,

1366
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:32,046
everyone was making
a good wage.

1367
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:35,549
Blaine was on the map.

1368
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:49,563
By the pool

1369
00:58:49,563 --> 00:58:52,066
In the school,
by the fires of yule

1370
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,568
It's the rule

1371
00:58:54,568 --> 00:58:56,070
There's a stool,
there's a stool

1372
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,572
Stools are where

1373
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:01,075
Once upon a time
you'd find a chair

1374
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:03,077
A chair's for fools

1375
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:06,080
Everybody wants stools

1376
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,082
Stool boom

1377
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:11,085
From the parlor
to the pool room

1378
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,588
We're the center
of a stool boom

1379
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:18,592
?
Everyone knows our name?

1380
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:20,594
Working, building

1381
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,096
Never stopping,
never sleeping

1382
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,597
Working, making

1383
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,099
Some for selling,
some for keeping

1384
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,101
You will drool

1385
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:29,603
At the splendor of
these magic stools

1386
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:32,106
It's the rule

1387
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:34,108
Everyone has a stool

1388
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:36,110
Just 3 legs

1389
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,612
It's a thing
for which a monarch begs

1390
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:40,614
Hock your jewels

1391
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:43,117
Use the money for stools

1392
00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:45,119
Stool boom

1393
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,623
Just 3 legs
and watch the sales zoom

1394
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:52,126
Like a fever,
it's a stool boom

1395
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:56,631
And it's spreading out
from blaine

1396
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:58,132
Working, building

1397
00:59:58,132 --> 00:59:59,634
Never stopping,
never sleeping

1398
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:01,135
Working, making

1399
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,637
Some for selling,
some for keeping

1400
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:04,639
Working, building

1401
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,641
Never stopping,
never sleeping

1402
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:09,143
Working, making

1403
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:11,145
Some for selling

1404
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:15,149
Some for keeping

1405
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:17,652
Whew.

1406
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,303
I can't wait
to see the second half.

1407
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:46,806
Allan, his dramatic work...

1408
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,307
i mean,
i knew he was funny,

1409
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:52,311
and i knew he could move, dance,
'cause he's that way,

1410
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:57,316
but i think his dramatical work
is so moving that, um...

1411
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:59,819
well, i mean,
i called joyce and i said,

1412
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,822
"joyce, bring joshie 'cause
i gotta feed him halftime

1413
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,323
'cause i'm just busting."

1414
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:06,325
This is good.
Boy, they're moving.

1415
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:07,326
They're dancing
all over the place

1416
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:09,328
and the songs
are very catchy.

1417
01:01:09,328 --> 01:01:10,830
Uh, very catchy.

1418
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,832
Can't get a few of them
out of my head.

1419
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:14,333
Almost to
an annoying point,

1420
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:17,336
but i think it's good
when a song is catchy.

1421
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:21,340
From the little experience
i have in show business.

1422
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,344
I knew corky that could act
and direct and produce,

1423
01:01:25,344 --> 01:01:27,346
but who knew he was going
to act and sing and dance?

1424
01:01:27,847 --> 01:01:30,349
You know, he can just do
everything there is to do,

1425
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,351
and there's only one
other person in the world

1426
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:34,854
that can do that and
that's barbra streisand.

1427
01:01:34,854 --> 01:01:37,857
He is...

1428
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:40,359
I don't know.
An inspiration to this town.

1429
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:42,361
That's... that's what he is.

1430
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:45,364
And i, for one, am very glad

1431
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:47,366
to see that johnny savage
dropped out of the show,

1432
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,869
because a couple years ago,
he came into the drugstore

1433
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:52,371
and he tried to steal
my stamp machine,

1434
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:54,373
and that kid is no good.

1435
01:01:54,373 --> 01:01:56,375
You could tell just by
his parents he's no good,

1436
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,878
and he would not have added
anything to this show.

1437
01:01:58,878 --> 01:01:59,879
Where corky
on the other hand...

1438
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:01,380
Iook at him! Did you see...

1439
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,842
god, i wish
i was in the show!

1440
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:26,906
I hear that
french girls...

1441
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:29,408
are very pretty.

1442
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:31,911
That they wear
the finest of clothes.

1443
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:34,413
I also hear
that they are experts

1444
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,415
in the ways of love.

1445
01:02:36,415 --> 01:02:39,919
Ima, i'm going to fight
for my country.

1446
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:42,922
To fight, and yes,
perhaps die

1447
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:46,425
so that young men
from here to timbuktu

1448
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:50,429
can feel the wind of freedom
blowing through their hair.

1449
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:54,433
Oh, monty, i didn't
mean to doubt you.

1450
01:02:54,433 --> 01:02:59,438
It's just sometimes i feel
as if i don't really know you.

1451
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,943
I would still pay.

1452
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:09,949
A penny for
your thoughts

1453
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:12,952
A dime
for your dreams

1454
01:03:12,952 --> 01:03:15,955
Would a shiny
new quarter

1455
01:03:15,955 --> 01:03:19,458
Buy a peek
at your schemes?

1456
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:22,962
And when you are away

1457
01:03:22,962 --> 01:03:25,965
So far from my side

1458
01:03:25,965 --> 01:03:29,468
I will cherish
my penny's won'th

1459
01:03:29,468 --> 01:03:33,472
Till at last
i'm your bride

1460
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:40,980
A penny for
your thoughts

1461
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,482
Let's call it
a deal

1462
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:46,986
I don't have
any secrets

1463
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:50,489
You know
how i feel

1464
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:52,491
That's it. No, no.
Hey, here.

1465
01:03:52,491 --> 01:03:53,492
Where?

1466
01:03:53,492 --> 01:03:54,493
You know where
i like the curl.

1467
01:03:54,493 --> 01:03:55,995
Ron, i have to get
myself ready.

1468
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:57,997
There it is. Nice.

1469
01:03:57,997 --> 01:04:01,000
Now, a little fluff here
and you can work on yourself.

1470
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,003
A penny for
your thoughts

1471
01:04:04,003 --> 01:04:06,505
It's settled
and done

1472
01:04:07,006 --> 01:04:10,009
I'd have offered
a million

1473
01:04:10,009 --> 01:04:14,013
I'd have done it
for none

1474
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:17,516
I reckon
we're in love

1475
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:20,019
And married
we'll be

1476
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,522
And all
for a penny

1477
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:26,525
A bright
copper penny

1478
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:30,529
The penny
that brought you

1479
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:35,034
To me

1480
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:05,564
It was so good.

1481
01:05:05,564 --> 01:05:07,566
I told you you'd be able
to lift me like that.

1482
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:09,068
Ha ha! You were right!

1483
01:05:09,068 --> 01:05:10,569
You lifted me up!

1484
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:14,949
Yes, after our brave fighting
boys returned from the war,

1485
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:16,951
things got
back to normal in blaine.

1486
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:20,454
Until one summer night
in 1946,

1487
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:25,960
when unexpected visitors
put us back on the map.

1488
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:30,965
Where are we?

1489
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:31,966
How did we get here?

1490
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:34,468
Is this a dream?

1491
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:39,974
Look,
what is it?

1492
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:41,475
I don't know.

1493
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:43,477
It looks like one of them
new feed storage bins.

1494
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:45,479
That ain't no
feed storage bin!

1495
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:46,981
How did it
get here?

1496
01:05:46,981 --> 01:05:48,482
It must've flew!

1497
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:50,484
But it don't
have any wings.

1498
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,486
Then i guess
it just dropped...

1499
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:54,488
from somewhere
up there.

1500
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:56,991
Citizens of blaine,

1501
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,492
do not be alarmed.

1502
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,494
We will not harm you.

1503
01:06:00,494 --> 01:06:04,999
We come in peace from
a planet far, far away.

1504
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:07,501
A place we call mars.

1505
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:09,003
I've heard
of mars.

1506
01:06:09,003 --> 01:06:10,004
Where's that?

1507
01:06:10,004 --> 01:06:14,008
Stand back and
your queries will be answered.

1508
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,512
Look out!

1509
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,521
What do you want
from us?

1510
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:30,524
A good question, earthling.

1511
01:06:30,524 --> 01:06:33,027
It seemed like
it was time for a change.

1512
01:06:33,027 --> 01:06:34,528
Time to take a trip

1513
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:38,032
to see the exciting places
in the galaxy.

1514
01:06:38,532 --> 01:06:39,533
For you see...

1515
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:43,537
Nothing
ever happens on mars

1516
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:45,539
No sports
or entertainment

1517
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,541
Or swinging bars

1518
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:49,543
You stand around

1519
01:06:50,044 --> 01:06:51,545
You stand some more

1520
01:06:51,545 --> 01:06:55,549
On a planet named
for a roman god of war

1521
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,553
Nothing ever
happens on mars

1522
01:07:00,054 --> 01:07:02,056
?
No supersonic airplanes?

1523
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:04,058
No sporty cars

1524
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:06,060
The sun comes up

1525
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,561
The sun goes down

1526
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:09,563
You can't
go to the country

1527
01:07:09,563 --> 01:07:12,066
You can't go to town

1528
01:07:12,066 --> 01:07:13,567
Boring, boring

1529
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:16,070
Boring, boring

1530
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:18,572
Boring, boring

1531
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:21,075
Boring

1532
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,876
Well, the town of blaine

1533
01:07:30,876 --> 01:07:32,878
has packed a lot
in the last 150 years.

1534
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:36,382
We've had our ups
and we've had our downs.

1535
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:37,883
We've seen our past

1536
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:40,386
and we look forward
to the future.

1537
01:07:40,386 --> 01:07:42,388
And when
the challenges come,

1538
01:07:42,388 --> 01:07:44,890
we'll greet them
the way americans always do,

1539
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,893
with grit,
determination, and pride.

1540
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:51,897
Because that,
my friends, isamerica.

1541
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:55,401
And nothir
says america more to me

1542
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:57,903
than blaine!

1543
01:08:56,963 --> 01:08:58,965
Aah! Corky!

1544
01:08:58,965 --> 01:09:00,466
Corky!

1545
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:11,310
Mmm! You're so brilliant!
You're brilliant!

1546
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:13,813
Cliff, you're great.
Everyone is so great!

1547
01:09:13,813 --> 01:09:15,815
Ohh, dr. Pearl!

1548
01:09:16,315 --> 01:09:17,316
Corky, you did it!

1549
01:09:17,316 --> 01:09:18,818
Thank you! Mmm!

1550
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:21,821
I'm going to get mr. Guffman.
I'll be right backstage.

1551
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:27,326
It was great.

1552
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:30,329
Hello, how are you?

1553
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:31,330
Hi.

1554
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:32,832
It's nice to meet you.

1555
01:09:33,332 --> 01:09:34,333
And you, too.

1556
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,835
Boffo socko, corky.

1557
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:36,836
Thank you so much,
mr. Mayor.

1558
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:37,837
Wait'll they hear
about this

1559
01:09:37,837 --> 01:09:39,338
at the next mayor's
conference.

1560
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:40,339
Thank you so much.

1561
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:42,341
I know we have
a lot of work to do,

1562
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:43,342
the first act needs...

1563
01:09:43,843 --> 01:09:44,844
that was magic.

1564
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:46,345
Thank you very much,
steve.

1565
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:47,847
God!
Thank you so much.

1566
01:09:47,847 --> 01:09:51,350
Which we've got... the first act,
it's just up and down.

1567
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,352
Kind of dipping in and out,
and i know that,

1568
01:09:53,352 --> 01:09:55,354
just don't have the time
to do everything.

1569
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:57,857
So, i'm gonna ask you
point-blank...

1570
01:09:57,857 --> 01:09:59,358
do we have a shot
to go to broadway?

1571
01:09:59,358 --> 01:10:00,860
Yes, i think so.

1572
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,363
Ohh, mamma mia!
That is such good news.

1573
01:10:04,864 --> 01:10:07,366
Oh, i can't tell you
what news that is to me.

1574
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:08,868
Would you like
to meet the cast?

1575
01:10:08,868 --> 01:10:09,869
I'd like that, yeah.

1576
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:13,372
Oh, great.
Come on with me, you.

1577
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:14,373
Ohh!

1578
01:10:14,373 --> 01:10:16,876
Mr. Pro!
Wonderful job.

1579
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:18,878
You, too.
That blaine...

1580
01:10:18,878 --> 01:10:20,880
Everybody!

1581
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,381
Ha ha ha!

1582
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:23,883
Ohh!
Ohh!

1583
01:10:25,384 --> 01:10:28,387
Yes!

1584
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:29,889
Our cast.

1585
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:32,892
Thank you.
You were just great.

1586
01:10:32,892 --> 01:10:33,893
Oh ho ho!

1587
01:10:35,895 --> 01:10:38,397
Well, i'd like... please,
introduce yourselves.

1588
01:10:38,898 --> 01:10:41,400
Sheila... sheila albertson.

1589
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,902
I was?
You were great.

1590
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:44,904
Mrs. Ron albertson.
I'm ron albertson.

1591
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:46,906
It's a pleasure to
perform for someone...

1592
01:10:46,906 --> 01:10:48,407
this came
a couple hours ago.

1593
01:10:48,908 --> 01:10:49,909
I'm sorry i'm just now
getting it to you.

1594
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:51,410
Oh, thank you,
sweetie.

1595
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,912
Clifford wooley.

1596
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:53,913
Mr. Wooley.

1597
01:10:53,913 --> 01:10:54,914
Nice to meet you.

1598
01:10:54,914 --> 01:10:55,915
Allan pearl.

1599
01:10:55,915 --> 01:10:57,416
You... you make me laugh.

1600
01:10:57,416 --> 01:11:00,419
Oh, it's a delight
to meet you, sir.

1601
01:11:00,419 --> 01:11:03,422
Well, i'm sure that
mr. Guffman would like

1602
01:11:03,422 --> 01:11:05,925
to say a few words to us.

1603
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:07,426
Hear, hear!

1604
01:11:07,426 --> 01:11:09,929
Speech,
speech, speech!

1605
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:11,931
I think there's
some mistake.

1606
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:13,432
My name is loomis.
Roy loomis.

1607
01:11:13,432 --> 01:11:14,934
I'm down from deming.

1608
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:16,936
I came down, my niece
had her first baby.

1609
01:11:16,936 --> 01:11:18,437
Yeah, it's a boy.

1610
01:11:18,437 --> 01:11:20,940
That's what
the balloon is for.

1611
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,442
I just wanted
to tell you

1612
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:25,945
how just absolutely
wonderful you all were.

1613
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:30,449
And thank you. And
i'll be seeing you.

1614
01:11:30,449 --> 01:11:33,953
And bless you.
He's gonna love this.

1615
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:34,954
oh, boy.

1616
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:46,966
Take our
makeup off. Ahem.

1617
01:12:05,484 --> 01:12:07,486
"Snowstorm in new york.

1618
01:12:07,486 --> 01:12:10,990
"All flights canceled.

1619
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,993
Mort guffman."

1620
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,684
I think the one really
important thing that i learned

1621
01:12:38,684 --> 01:12:43,189
uh, from my whole experience
in working with corky,

1622
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:50,196
is that
i do indeed have talent.

1623
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:53,199
And a couple of things,
actually.

1624
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:58,704
"B"...i have to entertain.

1625
01:12:58,704 --> 01:13:00,206
I have to entertain.

1626
01:13:00,706 --> 01:13:04,710
And you have to go
where you are needed,

1627
01:13:05,211 --> 01:13:06,712
you have to go where
the crowds are,

1628
01:13:06,712 --> 01:13:13,219
and you have to go
where the love is.

1629
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:16,222
And the love, for me,
right now

1630
01:13:16,222 --> 01:13:18,224
is in miami.

1631
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:19,725
Not blaine.

1632
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,727
My bubbee made
a kishke

1633
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:23,729
She made it
big and fat

1634
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:25,231
My sadie took
one look at it

1635
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:26,732
And said,
"i can't eat that!"

1636
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:28,734
Oh, mama, mama, mama

1637
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:32,238
Oh, mama, me, oh, my

1638
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:34,740
Well, here we are
in the land of dreams,

1639
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:37,743
and don't let anybody tell you
dreams can't come true.

1640
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:39,745
We're an hour from the snow,

1641
01:13:39,745 --> 01:13:41,747
we're 20 minutes
from the ocean,

1642
01:13:41,747 --> 01:13:43,749
2 hours from the mexico.

1643
01:13:43,749 --> 01:13:45,751
5 hours from vegas.

1644
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:47,753
And we're gonna get there
one of these days.

1645
01:13:47,753 --> 01:13:48,754
Soon as we get a car.

1646
01:13:48,754 --> 01:13:51,757
We don't have a car yet. Who
wants to add to the pollution?

1647
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:53,759
We consider ourselves
bl-coastal if you consider

1648
01:13:53,759 --> 01:13:57,263
the mississippi river
one of the coasts.

1649
01:13:57,763 --> 01:13:59,265
Wo Extras, let's go.
Over here.

1650
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:01,267
All right. Time
to get back to work.

1651
01:14:01,267 --> 01:14:02,768
That's what they're
paying us for.

1652
01:14:02,768 --> 01:14:04,770
Can't they even refer
to us by name?

1653
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,273
Why can't they say,
"ron, sheila,

1654
01:14:07,273 --> 01:14:08,274
we're this way,
please"?

1655
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:10,776
Still the same paycheck,
honey. How you doing?

1656
01:14:10,776 --> 01:14:11,777
All right.

1657
01:14:11,777 --> 01:14:13,279
You're doing a great
job, incidentally.

1658
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:15,281
Face towards the camera
and smile.

1659
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,782
Are you gonna smile?

1660
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:18,784
I think we should
have a line.

1661
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:20,286
I gave him some suggestions.
He didn't want to hear...

1662
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:22,288
we should be
line-dancing.

1663
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,289
That's a great idea.

1664
01:14:23,789 --> 01:14:25,291
Quiet, please!

1665
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,293
Get your finger up.
Keep smiling.

1666
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:30,796
Quiet, please.

1667
01:14:30,796 --> 01:14:32,298
I was on
my way to new york,

1668
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:35,301
and then my dad
got out of prison.

1669
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:38,304
Which is good.

1670
01:14:38,304 --> 01:14:39,805
He was supposed to be
in there for 10 years,

1671
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:42,308
but i guess since
he didn't kill anybody,

1672
01:14:42,308 --> 01:14:46,812
he just... ruined
some property,

1673
01:14:46,812 --> 01:14:49,315
that they let him out
after 5.

1674
01:14:49,315 --> 01:14:53,319
So, it's... i'm here
with my dad.

1675
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:56,822
And, um...

1676
01:14:56,822 --> 01:14:58,824
i've been thinking
of ice cream and stuff

1677
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:00,326
and what i could do
with it.

1678
01:15:00,326 --> 01:15:04,330
Maybe... we have a blizzard
and we have a breeze.

1679
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,332
We have derbies.

1680
01:15:06,332 --> 01:15:08,334
The derbies are really old.

1681
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:11,337
They've been doing derbies...
the chocolate dip...

1682
01:15:11,337 --> 01:15:14,840
for, i think 20 years
or something.

1683
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,844
I really want to sort of
make a healthy

1684
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:23,349
low-fat or non-fat, um...

1685
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:26,352
healthy...

1686
01:15:26,852 --> 01:15:27,853
blizzard.

1687
01:15:28,312 --> 01:15:30,356
The first thing i did

1688
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:33,859
when i moved back
to new york city,

1689
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:35,861
was to look up mr. Guffman.

1690
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:38,864
And he was so sweet,

1691
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:40,866
and i think he felt
a little guilty, too,

1692
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:42,868
because he's
offered me the chance

1693
01:15:42,868 --> 01:15:45,371
to audition for
his new broadway show

1694
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:48,374
which is a revival
ofmy fair lady.

1695
01:15:48,374 --> 01:15:50,376
It's one of my favorite
shows of all time.

1696
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:54,380
And the role is
of 'enry 'iggins,

1697
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,383
the somewhat-
stern-taskmaster-

1698
01:15:57,383 --> 01:16:00,386
but-he-really-likes-her-
anyway-kind-of-thing guy

1699
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:03,389
who teaches eliza
to speak correctly.

1700
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:06,392
And she of course is of
the cockney persuasion

1701
01:16:06,892 --> 01:16:08,394
and drops her hs.

1702
01:16:08,394 --> 01:16:09,895
And i've been
working on that at home,

1703
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:13,399
the whole cockney thing of,
"'ello, 'ow are 'oo?"

1704
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:15,401
"Do you want
to go to 'artford?"

1705
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:18,904
"Not live in this 'ell'ole."
And that kind of thing.

1706
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:21,407
I think i'm honing in on it
pretty close now.

1707
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:25,411
And i suppose that
the cake-and-eat-it-too part

1708
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:26,912
of this whole story

1709
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,415
is that another dream
of mine has come true,

1710
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:31,917
which is that i've gotten
to open this shop...

1711
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:35,421
where i have all
my show business treasures

1712
01:16:35,421 --> 01:16:37,423
and all my memorabilia.

1713
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:40,926
This is without a doubt,
one of my favorite items.

1714
01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:45,431
Um, my dinner with andre
action figures,

1715
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:47,933
and what you can do,
which is so cute,

1716
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:51,437
is you can reenact
the whole scene.

1717
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:55,441
You know, where the two guys
talk to each other

1718
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:56,942
and say, you know...

1719
01:16:56,942 --> 01:16:59,945
"boy, i'm sure glad
you found a good restaurant.

1720
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:01,947
"You know, it's so hard
these days to get in.

1721
01:17:01,947 --> 01:17:03,949
Who do you know?"

1722
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:05,952
"Oh, i just called.

1723
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:08,955
Made a call.
Spur of the moment."

1724
01:17:08,955 --> 01:17:12,458
"Ha ha! Oh, you, you can
always get a reservation."

1725
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:15,962
You know.
That's not from the movie,

1726
01:17:15,962 --> 01:17:17,463
but you can make up
your own dialogue,

1727
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:19,465
which is one of the great things
about action figures.

1728
01:17:19,465 --> 01:17:22,343
I'm trying to get...
it's very rare...

1729
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:26,347
the one... the action figures
fordas boot,

1730
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:30,351
'cause i love to do that
whole claustrophobic thing

1731
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:33,354
inside the sub
where they're, you know,

1732
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:35,856
"das kande,
das mushtenstein."

1733
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:36,857
That whole german thing.

1734
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:39,360
Can't speak german,
but it sounds like

1735
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,862
sort of a bunch
of barnyard animals,

1736
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:44,865
"muck, muck, muck,"
making that noise and sweatir.

1737
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:49,370
Uh, over here,
these are my big heads,

1738
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:52,373
i call 'em, starting
with anthony michael hall,

1739
01:17:52,373 --> 01:17:54,875
one of the brat packers.

1740
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:57,378
In fact,
in the background there,

1741
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:59,380
there's andrew mccan'thy.

1742
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,884
Over here, some new lunchboxes
we've gotten in,

1743
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,886
the remains of the day
lunchbox,

1744
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:07,888
and the kids,
they're just having

1745
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:09,890
such a good time
with these, you know.

1746
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,393
Kids don't like
eating lunch at school,

1747
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:14,395
but if they're got
aremains of the daylunchbox,

1748
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:15,896
they're a whole lot happier.

1749
01:22:56,177 --> 01:22:59,180
There's
not much pleasure

1750
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:03,684
But not much pain

1751
01:23:03,684 --> 01:23:07,188
'cause
nothir ever happens

1752
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:12,193
Zero ever happens

1753
01:23:12,193 --> 01:23:16,197
Bupkiss ever happens

1754
01:23:16,697 --> 01:23:18,699
In...

1755
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:33,714
